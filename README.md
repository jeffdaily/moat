# MOAT

MOAT (Moat Obliteration via Automated Translation) ports popular CUDA GitHub projects to ROCm/HIP, one repo at a time, across AMD targets: Linux gfx90a, Linux gfx1100, and Windows gfx1151. It is driven by Claude: a planner analyzes each project, a porter applies the change on a fork in the jeffdaily org, a reviewer checks it, and a validator builds and runs the real tests on AMD hardware. This repo is the control plane; it tracks progress and accumulates porting best practices in PORTING_GUIDE.md.

## How it works

Each project gets a folder under `projects/` holding its plan, notes, and a per-platform status file. A fresh Claude CLI run in this repo detects its AMD architecture, finds the next actionable project, and continues the pipeline. Linux gfx90a is the lead platform; gfx1100 and gfx1151 reuse the resulting fork branch and re-validate, since the three AMD targets share one unified ROCm port.

## Scope and honesty

The project list below is a best-effort ranked union of targeted GitHub searches, not a census of every CUDA repo (GitHub search caps results per query and misses repos whose dominant language is not Cuda). Ports aim to be minimally invasive: for pure CMake projects we prefer `enable_language(HIP)` plus a single cuda-to-hip compat header (the colmap model); for pytorch extensions we rely on torch's build-time hipify. A CPU-only build smoketest proves compilation only; correctness is gated on real-GPU test runs. See PORTING_GUIDE.md.

Projects we will not port (already ported, already supported, can't be ported, or not a real target) are recorded with reasons in `data/dispositions.json` and kept out of the actionable list; `utils/triage.py` manages those decisions.

Status legend: `todo` not started, `planning` / `porting` / `review` / `validating` in progress, `done` completed, `gated` waiting on the gfx90a port, `revalidate` the shared branch changed since this platform last passed, `blocked` needs input.
