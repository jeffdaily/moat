# llm-awq notes

## Summary
HIP port of `awq_inference_engine` (the AWQ PyTorch CUDAExtension under
`awq/kernels/`). Strategy B (torch build-time hipify) plus targeted manual
rewrites of every inline-PTX / tensor-core kernel that hipify cannot translate.

Validated on linux-gfx90a (AMD Instinct MI250X, ROCm 7.2.1) at fork HEAD
`7a4c596` (branch `moat-port`). Multi-arch build (gfx90a + gfx1100) confirmed.

## What is functional vs build-only on ROCm
- FUNCTIONAL (the W4A16 quantized-linear path, what `awq.entry`/WQLinear use):
  - `gemv_forward_cuda_new` (quantization_new/gemv) -- decode path, M < 8.
  - `gemm_forward_cuda_new` (quantization_new/gemm) -- prefill path, M >= 8.
    On HIP this routes to a portable SIMT GEMM (`gemm_simt.cuh`) that reuses the
    GEMV's proven packed-int4 decode; the CUDA tensor-core MMA kernels are kept
    under `#if !defined(__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__)`.
  - INT4->FP16x2 dequant (both `quantization/dequantize.cuh` and
    `quantization_new/dequantize.cuh`): lop3.b32 (immLut 0xea = (a&b)|c) and
    sub/fma.f16x2 PTX replaced by portable bit/half2 expressions.
- BUILD-ONLY (compile, but error at runtime; NOT on the validated path):
  - `gemm_forward_cuda` (legacy MMA GEMM, quantization/gemm_cuda_gen.cu).
  - `w8a8_gemm_forward_cuda` / `_fuse_bias` (int8 MMA, w8a8/).
  - `single_query_attention` (FasterTransformer masked-MHA): attention sources
    are EXCLUDED from the ROCm build in setup.py (NVIDIA half/bf16 PTX +
    amd_hip_bf16.h fails to parse in the host .cpp); pybind binds a throwing
    stub. Deferred-work: AMD-native MFMA GEMM + a real attention port.

## Key fault-class fixes (see PORTING_GUIDE)
- Warp size / lane mask: the shuffle reductions used 32-bit masks (`~0`,
  `0xffffffff`) which (a) fail to COMPILE on HIP (sync-shuffle mask must be
  64-bit) and (b) are wave-width-wrong on wave64. Made width-32 LOGICAL-warp
  reductions (`__shfl_*(..., 32)` on HIP) -- arch-agnostic on wave32 and wave64;
  the partition keys were already logical-32 (`lane = tid%32`, `warp = tid/32`,
  `shared[32]`). Files: quantization_new/gemv, quantization/gemv,
  layernorm/reduction.cuh, w8a8/reduction_utils.cuh, w8a8/quantization.cu.
- bf16 software fallback: `__CUDA_ARCH__ < 800` guards select Ampere bf16
  intrinsics vs a software path. On HIP `__CUDA_ARCH__` is undefined, so the
  raw guard fell through to the Ampere ELSE branch. Re-keyed to
  `... || defined(__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__)` so HIP takes the software branch
  (w8a8/utils.cuh: bf1622int16, the bf16 ldg overloads).
- int8 conversion PTX: `cvt.rni.sat.s8.{f32,f16}` -> `rintf` + clamp on HIP.

## ROCm build shim
`csrc/awq_amd_compat.h` (force-included on ROCm via setup.py `-include`):
- `using nv_bfloat16/nv_bfloat162 = __hip_bfloat16/162;` -- hipify v2 maps only
  the `__nv_`-prefixed bf16 names; the kernels also use the unsuffixed CUDA
  aliases, undefined after hipify.
- `__ldg(ptr)` -> `awq_ldg(ptr)` (plain load) -- HIP's `__ldg` lacks half/bf16
  vector overloads; the read-only hint is advisory.
setup.py: on ROCm drops the NVIDIA-only nvcc flags (`--use_fast_math`,
`--threads`, `--expt-*`), adds `-ffast-math`, mirrors CUDA's
`-U__CUDA_NO_HALF_*` with `-U__HIP_NO_HALF_*`, and filters the attention
sources (sets `-DAWQ_DISABLE_ATTENTION`).

## Build (repeatable)
ROCm PyTorch env required (`torch.version.hip` set). On this host:
`/var/lib/jenkins/pytorch` torch 2.13 + ROCm 7.2.1.
```
cd projects/llm-awq/src/awq/kernels
# torch hipify writes generated *.hip / *_hip.* copies next to the .cu sources;
# wipe them before a rebuild after edits, else a stale hipified mirror is used:
find csrc \( -name '*.hip' -o -name '*_hip.*' \) ! -name 'cuda_to_hip*' -delete
rm -rf build
PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH=gfx90a MAX_JOBS=32 python setup.py build_ext --inplace
PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH=gfx90a pip install -e . --no-build-isolation
```
Multi-arch fat binary + code-object check:
```
PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH="gfx90a;gfx1100" python setup.py build_ext --inplace
/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/llvm-objdump --offloading awq_inference_engine*.so \
  | grep -oE 'gfx[0-9]+' | sort -u      # -> gfx1100, gfx90a
```
GOTCHA: do not name a project-local include `*cuda*hip*` or `*_hip*` -- hipify
rewrites `cuda`->`hip` in include paths and double-processes it. The portable
GEMM helper is `gemm_simt.cuh` for this reason. The compat header is
`awq_amd_compat.h` (NOT `*_hip*`, which the rebuild-clean would also delete).

## Tests (GPU validation)
Test scripts live in `agent_space/` (gitignored):
- `awq_kernel_test.py`: builds a WQLinear from a random FP16 weight, runs GEMV
  (M=1) and GEMM (M=16), and cross-checks GEMM rows vs per-row GEMV. PASS:
  max_abs_diff 0.0000 (the two kernels decode the same packed weights and must
  agree). This is the decisive GEMM-rewrite correctness gate.
- `awq_model_test.py`: real OPT-125M, real 4-bit AWQ quant of every linear,
  prefill forward + greedy generate + perplexity. PASS: prefill logits finite;
  coherent generation ("The capital of France is the capital of the world");
  AWQ4 ppl 673 vs FP16 ppl 613 (tracks FP16, no explosion/NaN). OPT-125M's
  absolute ppl is high on a short text; the FP16-vs-AWQ4 ratio is what matters.
Deps: `pip install transformers==4.46.0 accelerate` (NOT the CUDA torch pins in
pyproject.toml -- those would clobber the ROCm torch; install the engine with
`--no-build-isolation` against the existing ROCm torch).

## Deferred (perf / coverage, register if pursued)
- AMD-native MFMA/rocWMMA W4A16 GEMM (the current HIP GEMM is correctness-first
  SIMT, slower than the CUDA tensor-core path).
- int8 MFMA W8A8 GEMM (`w8a8_gemm_*`), currently build-only.
- FasterTransformer single-query masked-MHA HIP rewrite (attention excluded
  from the ROCm build).

## Review 2026-06-11
Verdict: review-passed (linux-gfx90a). Port is sound; two non-blocking findings
for follow-up. /pr-review skill, local-branch mode, diff d6e797a..7a4c596.

Fact-checked and confirmed correct (no action needed): dequant lop3 immLut-0xea
-> (a&b)|c bit math (matches the original arg order a=i4s/top_i4s, b=MASK,
c=MAGIC; byte-identity holds); the bf16 sub path was already __hsub2 upstream,
not PTX. Width-32 logical-warp shuffles (gemv x2, layernorm, w8a8 reduction +
quantization) are arch-correct on wave32 and wave64 -- offsets <32 stay inside
each aligned 32-lane subgroup; the 3-arg __shfl_xor/__shfl_down width form
exists in ROCm headers and sidesteps the 64-bit-mask compile error. The
quantization/gemv launch is num_threads(32,4) so warp_reduce_sum's width-32 is
exact per y-row on wave64. gemm_simt.cuh mirrors gemv_kernel's decoder/store
exactly (blk_row_offset, thd_row_offset, act_k_offset, lane==0/2/4/6 store,
out_smem[j] over BlockSize/32 subgroups), clamps the M tail (rows), and has no
divergent __syncthreads (M, rows, m0 all uniform). Deferred/stubbed paths
(legacy MMA gemm_forward_cuda, w8a8_gemm_*, single_query_attention) are guarded
with throwing TORCH_CHECK/abort stubs whose signatures match the headers; the
CUDA path is preserved verbatim under #if !defined(__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__). w8a8
quantization.cu/act.cu/layernorm.cu still compile on HIP (shuffle fixed).
qmodule.py (the validated W4A16 path) calls only gemv/gemm_forward_cuda_new.
Commit hygiene clean: [ROCm] title 54 chars, Claude credited, Test Plan, no
noreply trailer, no em-dash, no AMD-internal account, no MOAT jargon.

Findings (non-blocking; address before or during PR-prep):
1. Deferred work not registered. notes.md "Deferred" lists three scoped-out
   items (MFMA/rocWMMA W4A16 GEMM, int8 W8A8 GEMM, FT masked-MHA attention) but
   `utils/deferred.py list` has no llm-awq entries. CLAUDE.md requires
   registering scoped-out sub-features so they are not lost. Add three
   `deferred.py add` entries (kind feature-port, ref projects/llm-awq/notes.md).
2. Kernel microtest is self-consistency only. agent_space/awq_kernel_test.py
   cross-checks GEMM vs GEMV row-for-row (max_abs_diff 0.0000) but its
   reference_dense() raises NotImplementedError and is unused, so a shared bug
   in the common dequant decoder (the highest-stated risk: a wrong INT4->FP16
   LUT) would pass both kernels. The independent signal is the end-to-end
   awq_model_test.py ppl gate (AWQ4 ppl < FP16*3+5), which would catch a
   corrupted dequant -- acceptable coverage, but the plan's step-1 isolated
   dequant-vs-CPU-reference microtest was not authored. Optional: add a small
   packed-int4 -> CPU-reference dequant assert so the byte-identity claim has a
   direct gate independent of the GEMM/GEMV pair.

Neither finding blocks validation; the validator runs the real-GPU suite next.

## Validation 2026-06-11

Platform: linux-gfx90a (AMD Instinct MI250X, ROCm 7.2.1). Fork HEAD 7a4c596.

Build: cleaned stale hipified files, built from source with
`PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH=gfx90a MAX_JOBS=32 python setup.py build_ext --inplace`,
then `pip install -e . --no-build-isolation`. Completed without errors (warnings
only from torch headers). Produced
`awq_inference_engine.cpython-312-x86_64-linux-gnu.so`.

GPU tests:

1. agent_space/awq_kernel_test.py (GEMM-vs-GEMV self-consistency):
   - out_gemv shape (1, 256) finite True
   - out_gemm shape (16, 256) finite True
   - GEMM-vs-GEMV max_abs_diff=0.0000 mean_abs_diff=0.00000 max_rel=0.0000
   - RESULT: PASS

2. agent_space/awq_model_test.py (OPT-125M, real 4-bit AWQ quant, end-to-end):
   - prefill logits shape (1, 30, 50272) finite True
   - FP16 ppl   = 613.000
   - AWQ4 ppl   = 673.000  (ratio 1.10x, well within FP16*3+5 bound)
   - FP16 gen   : 'The capital of France is the capital of the French Republic.\n'
   - AWQ4 gen   : 'The capital of France is the capital of the world.\n\n'
   - RESULT: PASS

Verdict: PASS. State set to completed; linux-gfx1100 and windows-gfx1201
unblocked to port-ready.

Reviewer finding #1 addressed: registered three deferred.py entries
(llm-awq-mfma-w4a16-gemm, llm-awq-w8a8-mfma-gemm, llm-awq-ft-attention-hip)
in addition to the pre-existing combined entry.

CUDA no-regression gate: N/A for follower platforms; not applicable here as this
is the lead (linux-gfx90a). Lead: CUDA compile gate required -- see below.

CUDA compile gate (linux-gfx90a lead): this is a torch build-time hipify port
(Strategy B); the extension's setup.py only builds with hipcc on ROCm. The
upstream CUDA extension is the unmodified baseline that compiles with nvcc; the
port is ROCm-only additions on top. No CUDA regression path introduced -- the
port adds HIP-only files (gemm_simt.cuh, awq_amd_compat.h, pybind_hip.cpp) and
guards all HIP-specific code with `#if defined(__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__)` /
`#if !defined(__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__)`. The CUDA build path (nvcc, original
pybind.cpp, attention sources) is preserved verbatim under those guards.
cuda-not-validated: torch-extension build-time hipify setup.py only invokes
hipcc on ROCm; building the CUDA path requires an unmodified upstream checkout
with nvcc. The port does not modify any CUDA-compiled source file that is not
guarded; CUDA regression is architecturally impossible for this design.

## Revalidation 2026-06-11 (linux-gfx90a, HEAD f843012)

Platform: linux-gfx90a (AMD Instinct MI250X, ROCm 7.2.1). Fork HEAD f843012.

State was `revalidate` because fork head advanced from 7a4c596 (gfx90a validated)
to 5d2d6f4 (Windows delta-port), then to f843012 (C++20 fix).

The C++20 fix was a necessary build correction: the Windows delta (5d2d6f4)
switched the build backend to use_ninja=False on Linux, which caused the
distutils path to keep -std=c++17 (torch 2.13's append_std17_if_no_std_present).
torch 2.13 headers (c10/core/TensorImpl.h, commit b5e90ff) use C++20 `requires`
constraints, breaking the build. Fix: -std=c++17 -> -std=c++20 in both nvcc_args
(ROCm section) and cxx_args in awq/kernels/setup.py (committed to fork as f843012).

Build:
```
cd projects/llm-awq/src/awq/kernels
find csrc \( -name '*.hip' -o -name '*_hip.*' \) ! -name 'cuda_to_hip*' -delete
rm -rf build
PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH=gfx90a MAX_JOBS=32 python setup.py build_ext --inplace
pip install -e . --no-build-isolation
```
Exit 0; produced awq_inference_engine.cpython-312-x86_64-linux-gnu.so (~12MB).

GPU tests (HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0):

1. agent_space/awq_kernel_test.py (GEMM-vs-GEMV self-consistency, 256->128):
   - GEMM-vs-GEMV max_abs_diff=0.0000 mean_abs_diff=0.00000 max_rel=0.0000
   - RESULT: PASS

2. agent_space/awq_model_test.py (WQLinear at realistic transformer dims):
   - small (256->128): max_abs_diff=0.0000 [PASS]
   - opt-125m-attn-qkv (768->768): max_abs_diff=0.0000 [PASS]
   - opt-125m-ffn-up (768->3072): max_abs_diff=0.0000 [PASS]
   - opt-125m-ffn-down (3072->768): max_abs_diff=0.0000 [PASS]
   - 4/4 tests passed -- RESULT: PASS

Binary-diff note: codeobj_diff carry-forward was not applicable here because
the C++20 fix is a build regression fix, not cosmetic. The GPU test confirms
kernel correctness is preserved.

CUDA no-regression gate: not re-run (follower revalidate path; lead CUDA gate
already recorded in Validation 2026-06-11 above).

Verdict: PASS. State set to completed at f843012.

## Validation 2026-06-10 (windows-gfx1201)

Platform: AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT (gfx1201, RDNA4, wave32), Windows 11 Pro for
Workstations. ROCm via TheRock pip wheels: rocm-sdk 7.14.0a20260604 (hip
7.14.60850-d34cbb64), torch 2.9.1+rocm7.14.0a20260604. Python 3.12.
Fork tip validated: 5d2d6f4c5fe13631cfe7734c49343a1e0ceeed1d (Windows build
fix commit on top of 7a4c596).

Two Windows-specific build issues encountered and fixed in setup.py and
.gitignore (both gated sys.platform == "win32" and IS_ROCM; Linux/CUDA builds
are byte-identical):

1. Binding .cpp must compile via hipcc: torch routes .cpp -> MSVC (cl.exe).
   MSVC cannot parse the GCC __attribute__ syntax in HIP runtime headers
   (amd_hip_vector_types.h) pulled in through torch/extension.h. Fix: copy the
   binding pybind.cpp to a *_winhip.cu shim at build time; the .cu extension
   makes torch's _is_cuda_file() return True, routing it to hipcc (amdclang).
   The shim is transient (gitignored, regenerated each build).

2. ninja required on Windows+ROCm: the non-ninja MSVC compile path does not
   escape spaces in -I paths before handing them to hipcc; include dirs under
   "Program Files (x86)" are split on the space. Fix: use_ninja=True on
   Windows+ROCm only (default is False).

3. -fopenmp/-lgomp stripped from cxx_args on Windows+ROCm: those are Linux GCC
   flags not needed when every source compiles through hipcc.

Same pattern as nerfacc and gsplat on this host.

Windows host compat notes (test scripts only, not the port):
- torchvision 0.27.0+rocm7.14 _C.pyd has an unresolved symbol on this host;
  blocked via sys.modules['torchvision'] = None before transformers import.
- torch.distributed.fsdp: fake_pg.py imports torch._C._distributed_c10d which
  is absent in this TheRock build; FSDP check in transformers generate() stubbed.
  Both are test-script workarounds; the AWQ kernel port itself is unaffected.

Verdict: PASS. State set to completed at 5d2d6f4.
