# RXMesh notes (linux-gfx90a lead port)

Upstream: owensgroup/RXMesh @ 30a4137. Strategy A (pure CMake; compat header +
`.cu` LANGUAGE HIP + USE_HIP option + arch from CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES).

## Build

Configure + build (GPU 0, gfx90a, ROCm 7.2.1):

```
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 cmake -S projects/RXMesh/src -B projects/RXMesh/build -G Ninja \
  -DUSE_HIP=ON -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx90a \
  -DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++ \
  -DRX_USE_POLYSCOPE=OFF -DRX_BUILD_APPS=OFF -DRX_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ninja -C projects/RXMesh/build RXMesh RXMesh_test
```

- `RX_USE_POLYSCOPE=OFF`: viz needs a display; all polyscope code is USE_POLYSCOPE-guarded.
- `RX_BUILD_APPS=OFF`: apps pull OpenMesh (CPU reference, fetched from a flaky
  non-standard-port git server) and the cusolverSp solver path; not needed to
  validate the core.
- Relocatable device code (`-fgpu-rdc` / HIP_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION) is REQUIRED:
  RXMesh declares `__device__` members in headers and defines them in separate
  `.cu` TUs, so the device linker must resolve them across TUs (the CUDA build
  uses CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION / -rdc=true for the same reason).

## Compat / build-system layer

- `include/rxmesh/util/cuda_to_hip.h`: runtime + cooperative-groups + cub alias,
  `__grid_constant__` -> empty on HIP, data-type enums. Includes <cstdlib>/<cstring>
  before hip_runtime.
- `include/rxmesh/util/cuda_to_hip_math.h`: hipBLAS/hipSOLVER/hipSPARSE handle +
  status + L1-BLAS + generic-sparse aliases + complex types. Included by macros.h.
- `include/rxmesh/hip_compat/`: HIP-only redirect headers (on the include path
  BEFORE the system path only under USE_HIP) so the CUDA include spellings
  (<cuda_runtime.h>, <cub/...>, <cooperative_groups.h>, <cuComplex.h>,
  <cublas_v2.h>, <cusparse.h>, <cuda_profiler_api.h>, ...) resolve to their HIP
  equivalents without editing every include site.
- CMake: root gates `project(... HIP)` vs CUDA on USE_HIP; RXMeshTarget marks the
  lib `.cu` LANGUAGE HIP, drops the unused cuBQL link + nvcc-only flags, swaps
  CUDA::cusparse/cusolver -> roc::hip*; RXMeshApp does the same for tests/apps.
  ThirdParty skips OpenMesh (apps-only) and cuBQL (CUDA-only) on HIP.

## Fault classes hit (the real porting work)

- WARP SIZE / wave64 (gfx90a is CDNA2, 64-lane): `WARP_SIZE` is now 64 on
  `__GFX9__`. The participation/deletion bitmasks are 32-bit words (one per 32
  mesh elements); a 64-lane `__ballot` spans TWO words, so a single uint32 ballot
  truncates lanes 32-63 and never writes the 2nd word. Added
  `ballot_sub_warp_32()` (kernels/util.cuh): 64-bit `__ballot`, each 32-lane
  sub-group extracts its own 32 bits and its lane-0 writes its word. Applied at
  `warp_update_mask` (dynamic deletion, dynamic_util.cuh) and `query_dispatcher`
  (participation bitmask).
- INLINE PTX: `lane_id()`/`warp_id()`/`dynamic_smem_size()`/`total_smem_size()`
  used `mov.u32 %0,%laneid|%warpid|%dynamic_smem_size|%total_smem_size` (CUDA-only
  asm). lane_id -> `__lane_id()`; warp_id -> `threadIdx.x/warpSize` (call sites
  only partition block-local work); the smem-size queries return 0xFFFFFFFF on HIP
  (only used by a debug over-allocation guard).
- `__CUDA_ARCH__` device/host split: NOT defined during HIP device compilation
  (HIP uses `__HIP_DEVICE_COMPILE__`). The pervasive `#ifdef __CUDA_ARCH__`
  device-vs-host data-pointer selection (e.g. Attribute::size/get_patch_info
  choosing m_d_* vs m_h_*) silently took the HOST branch on the GPU and
  dereferenced host pointers -> memory access fault in the query kernels. Rewrote
  every `#ifdef __CUDA_ARCH__` -> `#if defined(__CUDA_ARCH__) ||
  defined(__HIP_DEVICE_COMPILE__)` (and the `#ifndef` form) across include/. THE
  key correctness fix for the query path.
- `__CUDACC__` guards: HIP defines `__HIPCC__`, not `__CUDACC__`. lp_hashtable.h
  gated its `#include kernels/util.cuh` (and the in-shared-memory device path) on
  `#if defined(__CUDACC__)`, so on HIP `atomic_read` was undeclared and the device
  load path was dropped. Added `|| defined(__HIPCC__)` (lp_hashtable.h, attribute.h).
- clang strictness (vs nvcc/MSVC):
  - explicit instantiations must carry the same `__host__`/`__device__` target
    attributes as the primary (query.cu prologue/get_iterator -> __device__;
    patch_info.cu / attribute.cu glm/eigen -> __host__ __device__).
  - dependent member-template call needs `.template`: `query.dispatch<Op>` ->
    `query.template dispatch<Op>` (24 lib + 3 test sites).
  - dependent type as a ctor call needs `typename`: `HandleT::LocalT(x)` ->
    `typename HandleT::LocalT(x)` (cavity_manager_impl / context.h asserts).
  - a static constexpr member used as a non-type template arg must be qualified
    (`Attribute<T,H>::m_block_size`, not `attr.m_block_size`) -- accessing it via
    an instance is not a constant expression to clang (reduce_handle).
  - `.template` may only precede a template; `new_patch.template is_deleted(...)`
    (is_deleted is a plain overload) -> drop `.template`.
- Reference-member-to-temporary: `Iterator`'s `const LPHashTable&` member bound to
  a temporary `LPHashTable()` in the degenerate ctors (UB nvcc tolerates, clang
  rejects). Store it by value on HIP (it is a small handle, never reborrowed).
- `__shared__` of a non-trivially-constructible type is rejected by clang:
  `__shared__ LPPair s_stash[...]` (LPPair has a value-init ctor). Added
  RXMESH_SHARED_LPPAIR_ARRAY (lp_pair.cuh): on HIP back it with uninitialized
  aligned shared bytes (callers fill_n before use); CUDA path unchanged.
- `__nv_is_extended_*_lambda_closure_type` builtin (IS_HD_LAMBDA/IS_D_LAMBDA): no
  HIP/clang equivalent and no SFINAE-detectable substitute, so RXMeshStatic::
  for_each_*(location, lambda) cannot gate its device kernel launch on the closure
  type. On HIP the for_each(DEVICE, lambda) device branch is disabled (the lib
  itself only calls for_each(HOST, ...)); device iteration goes through the query
  path (Query::dispatch), which is what RXMesh's kernels actually use. Tests that
  exercise for_each(DEVICE,...) (test_attribute, test_indices) are excluded from
  the HIP test target.
- `cooperative_groups::memcpy_async`/`wait`: not in HIP cooperative groups.
  loader.cuh falls back to a synchronous block-strided copy on HIP; the deferred
  `cg::wait(block)` drains map to `block.sync()` (wait_for_copy).
- sm70 `#error` (ShmemMutex/ShmemMutexArray) and `#if __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 700`
  half-atomic histogram are CUDA-only ISA checks; gated to not fire / take the
  legacy uint32 path on HIP.
- hipProfilerStart/Stop return hipErrorNotSupported without a profiler tool; the
  CUDA_ERROR-wrapped profiler calls in the Queries benchmark were fatal (and the
  resulting exit() then hung HIP teardown) -> guarded out on HIP.

## Library scope

- cuBQL: linked in CMake but never #included in any source -> dropped on HIP.
- cuSolverSp (sparse direct Cholesky/QR: csrchol/csrqr/csrlsv*): NO hipSOLVER
  equivalent. The matrix/diff solver surface (test_solver, test_sparse_matrix,
  test_jacobian, test_hess, test_scalar, autodiff Newton) is excluded from the HIP
  test target. dense_matrix.h (pulled into the core via attribute.h) compiles via
  the hipBLAS L1 + hipSPARSE generic-API aliases. A full hipSOLVER/rocSOLVER port
  of the sparse direct solvers is follow-up work, not done here.

## Validation (GPU 0, gfx90a, HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0) -- RXMesh_test

Run: `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ./projects/RXMesh/build/bin/RXMesh_test --gtest_filter=<...>`

PASS -- 21 tests (the static query + core mesh data-structure path, RXMesh's
contribution and the bulk of the warp-cooperative surface, incl. the wave64
ballot fixes):
- RXMeshStatic.* (9): Queries (all 8 ops VV/VE/VF/EV/EF/FV/FE/FF x 1000 iters
  vs CPU reference), Oriented_VV_Open, Oriented_VV_Closed, EVDiamond,
  MultiQueries, BoundaryVertex, ForEach, ForEachOnDevice, Export.
- RXMesh.* (3 active): Iterator, LPPair, LPHashTable (Benchmark disabled upstream).
- Util.* (6): Scan (hipCUB), AtomicMin, AtomicAdd, Align, BlockMatrixTranspose, Tet.
- RXMeshDynamic (3): PatchScheduler, PatchLock, Validate.
Determinism: Queries / Oriented_VV pass identically across repeated runs; the
participation bitmask (where the wave64 ballot bug would corrupt non-
deterministically) is stable.

EDITING-TEST BLOCKERS (RandomFlips/RandomCollapse/TriangleRefinement/PatchSlicing):

== (1) ShmemMutex spin-lock deadlock -- ROOT-CAUSED AND FIXED ==
- Symptom: slice_patches waves spin forever in ShmemMutex::lock on
  `atomicCAS(m_mutex, 0, 1)` (kernels/shmem_mutex.cuh).
- The prior "garbage / per-lane m_mutex pointer under -fgpu-rdc" hypothesis was
  WRONG. A standalone HIP repro (agent_space/rxmesh_shmem_mutex/) of exactly the
  pattern -- a __device__ helper that points a member at a function-local
  __shared__ int (mirroring alloc()), then an atomicCAS spin-lock, exercised by
  256 threads (4 wave64 wavefronts) -- swept the full matrix:
    {helper inlined vs separate-TU} x {-fgpu-rdc on/off} x {static vs dynamic
    extern __shared__}. The original split lock()/unlock() form HANGS in ALL
  configurations (incl. inlined + rdc-off + static shared -- no cross-TU, no rdc).
  The repro also showed m_mutex is a VALID, lane-uniform shared address
  (0x1000000000000 is just the generic-address-space tag; low32 == 0). So the
  bug is neither -fgpu-rdc codegen, nor cross-TU, nor a garbage pointer.
- TRUE root cause: a SIMT spin-lock deadlock. CUDA Volta+ has Independent Thread
  Scheduling so a lane that wins the CAS makes forward progress to unlock() even
  while sibling lanes of the same warp spin. AMD CDNA (gfx90a, wave64) has NO
  per-lane forward-progress guarantee within a wavefront: the winning lane is
  stuck at SIMT reconvergence waiting on the losing lanes, which spin forever ->
  classic lockstep spin-lock deadlock. This is exactly what ShmemMutex's own
  `#error ... requires sm70 ... Independent Thread Scheduling` warns about.
- Folding the critical section into the CAS-acquire loop ("body-in-loop")
  does NOT help: the compiler peels acquiring lanes off the exec mask
  (s_andn2_b64 exec,...) and keeps the lock held until the body runs for the
  reconverged wave -> still deadlocks (repro: 10/10 hang at -O3).
- FIX (USE_HIP/__HIP_DEVICE_COMPILE__-guarded; CUDA path unchanged): wave-serialize
  the lock. Added ShmemMutex::critical_section(func) and
  ShmemMutexArray::critical_section(loc, func): elect one active lane of the
  wavefront at a time via __ballot(1)/__ffsll, let that single lane fully
  acquire/run/release, then retire its bit and move to the next. With only one
  contending lane per wavefront there is no intra-wavefront spin-lock hazard
  (cross-wavefront contention is fine -- wavefronts schedule independently).
  Repro: wave-serial is 10/10 correct & deadlock-free at -O3, incl. the
  subset-of-lanes-from-a-loop shape that mirrors copy_to_hashtable.
  Call sites converted: PatchStash::insert_patch(patch, ShmemMutex&)
  (patch_stash.h) and CavityManager::add_edge_to_cavity_graph's two
  ShmemMutexArray critical sections (cavity_manager_impl.cuh). rocgdb confirms
  the hang moves PAST the mutex (slice now completes for the first patch with
  valid counts 151/417/267). The two earlier "fixes" (__syncthreads in alloc;
  header-inlining insert_patch) were neither necessary nor sufficient.

== (2) compute_vf (Op::VF) shared-memory overflow in validate() -- FIXED ==
- RXMeshDynamic::validate()'s check_ribbon launches the VF query (compute_vf),
  which here needs ~81920 B (80 KB) of dynamic shared memory. gfx90a offers only
  64 KB/block, so the launch fails with "invalid argument". A following
  cudaDeviceSynchronize() does NOT clear it (no kernel was queued), so the sticky
  error poisons the next unrelated CUDA call (it broke Util.Scan when the suite
  ran end-to-end, and slice_patches' pre-launch checkpoint). This is a hardware
  capability gap, not a logic bug (CUDA targets have >=96 KB optin).
- FIX: in check_ribbon, query cudaFuncGetAttributes(compute_vf).
  maxDynamicSharedSizeBytes and, if the required dyn smem exceeds it, skip the
  VF-based ribbon-faces sub-check (the EV-based ribbon-edges check still runs),
  log a warning, and return -- no failed launch, no sticky error.

== (3) Post-edit patch metadata = INVALID16 -- ROOT-CAUSED AND FIXED ==
- Symptom: with (1)+(2) fixed, after one slice+cleanup cycle a patch's stored
  num_v/num_e/num_f read back as 0xFFFF (INVALID16); the next op's element-strided
  loops run on a ~65535 bound -> PatchSlicing runaway-spins and the cavity tests'
  update_host cudaMemcpy (rxmesh_dynamic.cu:~2871, size = 2*num_edges) faults
  "invalid argument".
- The prior "spurious wave64 active-bitmask bit in the cleanup recompute"
  hypothesis was WRONG. The Bitmask here is uniformly 32-bit-WORD indexed by
  element id (local_id/32, local_id%32, atomicOr(word + id/32)) -- width
  independent and correct on wave64 -- and the count recompute is
  atomicMax(&s_num_vertices, v+1) over s_vert_tag with NO __ballot/__popc/__ffs at
  all. So no stray-bit path exists there.
- TRUE root cause (a LATENT UPSTREAM __shared__ buffer overflow, benign on nvcc,
  fatal on hipcc/clang): remove_surplus_elements declares
  `__shared__ uint32_t s_patch_stash[PatchStash::stash_size]` (PatchStash::
  stash_size == 1<<6 == 64) but cleared it with
  `fill_n(s_patch_stash, LPHashTable::stash_size, INVALID32)` -- the WRONG length
  constant: LPHashTable::stash_size == 128. With block_size=256 the fill writes
  INVALID32 (0xFFFFFFFF) into words 0..127 of a 64-word array, overrunning 64
  words / 256 bytes past the end. Instrumented the addresses on gfx90a:
    s_patch_stash = 0x...0200, size 64, end = 0x...0300
    s_num_edges   = 0x...0300   (overflow word 64)
    s_num_faces   = 0x...0304   (overflow word 65)
    s_num_vertices= 0x...0308   (overflow word 66)
  i.e. clang places the kernel's __shared__ count accumulators IMMEDIATELY after
  s_patch_stash, so the overflow clobbers all three with 0xFFFFFFFF. Confirmed by
  printf at the write-back: `RSE-WRITE ... v=4294967295 e=4294967295 f=4294967295
  (in v=195 e=542 f=348)` -- entry counts VALID, recomputed counts == INVALID32,
  truncated to uint16 on store to num_*[0] == 0xFFFF = INVALID16. nvcc's layout
  happened to put the overrun on dead padding, which is why CUDA never saw it.
- FIX (one constant; CUDA path identical, no guard needed since it is just the
  array's own correct size): rxmesh_dynamic.cu:539-540
    fill_n<blockThreads>(s_patch_stash, uint16_t(PatchStash::stash_size),
                         INVALID32);
  (The store at ~584 already used PatchStash::stash_size correctly.) Verified A/B:
  with the original (128) constant, the overflow + INVALID16 reproduces; with the
  fix, PatchSlicing PASSES and is deterministic (3/3 runs, ~470 ms each, no smem
  warning).
- See PORTING_GUIDE changelog (the "INVALID16 cleanup-count fingerprint" lesson)
  for the generalized rule: a post-cleanup count that reads back all-ones and
  matches a sentinel a nearby fill/memset writes => a static-__shared__ array
  filled with a SIBLING array's length constant; clang's shared layout differs
  from nvcc's, so the overrun lands on a live neighbor on HIP.

== (4) slice_patches dynamic shared memory > 64 KB on the 2nd+ slicing cycle --
   DISTINCT, NOT cleanly fixable on gfx90a (hardware cap, NOT a wave64 bug) ==
- With (3) fixed, RandomFlips/RandomCollapse/TriangleRefinement no longer corrupt
  counts and progress through iter 0, but on the next slicing cycle the
  detail::slice_patches kernel itself requests ~82 KB dynamic + ~5 KB static
  (~87 KB total) shared memory (driven by per-patch cap_v/cap_e/cap_f for sphere3),
  which exceeds gfx90a's hard 64 KB/block cap. set_max_dynamic_smem already opts in
  to the full device max (sharedMemPerBlockOptin == 65536); the kernel's per-block
  request is simply larger than any opt-in gfx90a can grant (maxDynamicSharedSize
  for the func == 64216 B). check_shared_memory logs RXMESH_ERROR but its exit() is
  commented out, so the launch proceeds, fails, and the sticky "invalid argument"
  is caught at the NEXT slice_patches's cudaGetLastError (rxmesh_dynamic.h:785).
- This is the SAME hardware-capability-gap class as fix (2) (compute_vf 80 KB VF
  query) -- CUDA targets get 96-227 KB opt-in shared memory; CDNA2 gfx90a offers
  only 64 KB. It is NOT a wave64 logic bug. Unlike (2), slice_patches is core
  functionality and cannot be skipped; fitting it under 64 KB needs algorithmic
  kernel restructuring (smaller block_size, or staging the 11 masks +
  connectivity through shared in tiles), which is out of scope for the localized
  INVALID16 fix and is left as the next editing-path work item.
- PatchSlicing PASSES because its test mesh's per-patch capacities keep
  slice_patches within the 64 KB budget (no smem-overflow warning observed).

== (5) PatchLock test flakiness -- PRE-EXISTING, independent of (3) ==
- RXMeshDynamic.PatchLock is a distributed deadlock-avoidance lock test (1000
  iters; one block/patch each tries to lock its own + all other patch locks in a
  shuffled order via PatchLock::acquire_lock's atomicCAS; asserts EXACTLY one
  block wins per iter, sum==1). It is genuinely flaky on gfx90a: 8/10 pass in
  isolation; it also fails when run right after the heavy RXMeshStatic.Queries /
  MultiQueries tests. A/B confirms this reproduces with the ORIGINAL (count=128)
  code too, so it is NOT a regression from the (3) fix (which only touches the
  cleanup count recompute; PatchLock never calls cleanup()). This is a wave64
  lock-protocol concurrency limitation in acquire_lock (same family as the
  ShmemMutex SIMT issue), pre-existing and out of scope for this run. The prior
  pass's "PatchLock 10/10, flakiness was a stale binary" note was over-optimistic;
  the flake is real.

Verdict: ShmemMutex hang (1) and compute_vf smem overflow (2) FIXED; the INVALID16
post-edit count corruption (3) ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED (s_patch_stash fill length bug)
-- PatchSlicing now PASSES deterministically. The 3 cavity editing tests
(RandomFlips/RandomCollapse/TriangleRefinement) are now blocked ONLY by (4),
slice_patches's >64 KB shared-memory request on the 2nd slicing cycle, a gfx90a
hardware cap (not a wave64 bug) needing kernel restructuring -- a DISTINCT
remaining item, stopped here per bounded scope. Core 21 tests pass individually;
PatchLock (5) is flaky in-suite and in isolation, pre-existing and not caused by
the (3) fix. Determinism: PatchSlicing 3/3; the static query suite stable.
Standalone ShmemMutex repro + full matrix: agent_space/rxmesh_shmem_mutex/.

## 2026-05-30 -- sparse-solver dependency analysis (cuDSS / cusolverSp) + STRUMPACK dep

RXMesh's solver/autodiff path uses NVIDIA sparse solvers; the ROCm story per facility:
- High-level cusolverSp solve (csrlsvqr/csrlsvchol): AVAILABLE in hipSOLVER (hipsolverSp*, rocSPARSE+SuiteSparse backend, BUILD_WITH_SPARSE). Portable today.
- Low-level cusolverSp factorization (csrqr*/csrchol* Setup/BufferInfo/Factor/Solve/ZeroPivot), csrlsvluHost, csrsymrcm reordering: NOT in hipSOLVER. Feature request filed: https://github.com/ROCm/hipSOLVER/issues/443
- cuDSS (used heavily here): proprietary/closed-source -> NOT portable. Open ROCm-capable substitute: STRUMPACK (BSD; multifrontal sparse LU; already HIP/ROCm; ~1.9x faster than cuDSS single-GPU per a 2025 paper).

DEPENDENCY: RXMesh depends_on STRUMPACK, which is now `completed` in MOAT (BSD
multifrontal sparse LU, validated single-GPU on gfx90a). The solver path
substitutes cuDSS -> STRUMPACK (and the high-level cusolverSp solve ->
hipSOLVER csrlsvchol). This is SEPARATE from the editing path; the core
mesh-query + editing port does not need STRUMPACK.

## 2026-05-30 -- editing-port status after the INVALID16 fix (this run)

Core mesh-data-structure path, the full static mesh-query path, and the
dynamic-editing PatchSlicing path are now DONE and GPU-validated on gfx90a:
- 21 core tests pass (individually); PatchSlicing passes deterministically.
- The INVALID16 post-edit-count corruption is root-caused + fixed (s_patch_stash
  fill used LPHashTable::stash_size=128 instead of PatchStash::stash_size=64,
  overflowing 256 B into the adjacent __shared__ count accumulators on clang's
  layout -- see blocker (3)).

REMAINING FOLLOW-ONS (both distinct from the now-fixed INVALID16 bug; NOT done
in this run, per bounded scope):
1. The 3 cavity editing tests (RandomFlips/RandomCollapse/TriangleRefinement) are
   blocked on slice_patches requesting >64 KB dynamic shared memory on the 2nd
   slicing cycle -- a gfx90a hardware cap, needs kernel restructuring (blocker (4)).
2. The cuDSS -> STRUMPACK solver substitution (high-level solve -> hipSOLVER
   csrlsvchol). STRUMPACK is the recorded dep and is now completed in MOAT.

## 2026-05-30 (run 2) -- editing tests GREEN: blocker (4) was MISDIAGNOSED; real cause = a hardcoded 80 KB launch-box override

THE 3 CAVITY EDITING TESTS NOW PASS on gfx90a (RandomFlips, RandomCollapse,
TriangleRefinement), deterministically (3/3 repeated runs). Core 22 (21 + 
PatchSlicing) unregressed. The fix is ONE line, not a kernel restructuring.

=== Blocker (4) re-root-caused -- it is NOT slice_patches, and NOT a real >64 KB
    requirement ===
The prior run attributed the >64 KB shared-memory request to detail::slice_patches
and concluded the kernel needed tiling/splitting. That was WRONG. Instrumenting
the actual byte budgets showed:
- slice_patches' own host-computed dyn_shmem (rxmesh_dynamic.h:807-827) is only
  ~23298 B for sphere3's capacities (cap_v=549, cap_e=1581, cap_f=1034). It fits
  the 64 KB cap with room to spare and was never the failing launch. The
  "82477 B" the prior run saw was attributed to slice_patches but actually came
  from a DIFFERENT kernel's launch box.
- The 82477 B request belongs to the cavity EDITING kernels (random_flips /
  random_collapse / tri_refine), sized by RXMeshDynamic::update_launch_box
  (rxmesh_dynamic.cu). That function carefully computes the CavityManager
  footprint (connectivity + cavity-id + bitmasks + ... ) and arrives at a value
  that, for these meshes, is only ~14880-34015 B -- comfortably under 64 KB.
- BUT immediately after computing it, upstream UNCONDITIONALLY overwrites it:
      launch_box.smem_bytes_dyn = 80 * 1024;          // rxmesh_dynamic.cu:3239
  (present verbatim in pristine upstream 30a4137:3216). With with_vertex_valence
  it becomes 81920 + cap_v + 8 = 82477. On NVIDIA the 96-227 KB opt-in swallows
  the 80 KB slack so nobody noticed; on CDNA2's hard 64 KB/block cap the launch
  is rejected with "invalid argument", whose sticky error was then caught at the
  NEXT slice_patches' pre-launch cudaGetLastError (rxmesh_dynamic.h:785) -- which
  is why it LOOKED like slice_patches was the offender. Classic sticky-error
  misattribution across kernel launches.

=== FIX (rxmesh_dynamic.cu:3237-3247, __HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__-guarded) ===
Drop the 80 KB override on AMD and use the value update_launch_box already
computed (the kernel's true ShmemAllocator footprint). CUDA path is byte-for-byte
unchanged (still takes the 80 KB line). The guard is on the host macro
__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__ (same macro the porter uses in shmem_allocator.cuh:92);
update_launch_box is host code so this is a host-side #if. No gfx90a hardcoding:
the value is the computed per-capacity footprint, and check_shared_memory reads
the device cap from cudaDeviceProp, so it scales to any AMD target.

Why a guard rather than deleting the line outright: deleting it would also change
CUDA (improving its occupancy, since 14-34 KB << 80 KB), which is a behavior
change outside this port's mandate. Per the MOAT rule "if a change would alter
CUDA, guard the ROCm path," the override is left intact for NVIDIA.

=== Post-fix budgets (gfx90a, sphere3 / bumpy-cube) ===
random_flips dyn_shmem: was forced to 82477 B (FAIL, > 64216 func max);
now 14880 B (iter 0) -> 34015 B (steady), + 5192 static = 39207 B total, fits
(occupancy 1 block/SM). slice_patches unchanged at ~23298 B. The compute_vf VF
ribbon query (blocker (2)) still legitimately wants ~81920 B and is still skipped
by the validate() guard -- that one IS a real per-capacity requirement and is the
only place the 64 KB cap genuinely bites; it is non-fatal (EV-based ribbon check
still runs).

=== TriangleRefinement input ===
The TriangleRefinement test hardcodes input/rocker-arm.obj, which ships NOWHERE in
the RXMesh repo (not tracked in upstream 30a4137, 404 on raw.githubusercontent).
It is a separate test-DATA gap, unrelated to the port. To validate the refinement
kernel on bundled data, the test input was switched to input/bumpy-cube.obj
(tests/RXMesh_test/test_triangle_refinement.cu:146) -- a larger closed manifold
(~60k lines, 227 patches) that exercises the slice/cavity path harder than
rocker-arm would. With it, TriangleRefinement passes deterministically.

=== Validation (GPU 0, gfx90a, HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0, Release) ===
- RandomFlips / RandomCollapse / TriangleRefinement: PASS, 3/3 repeated runs.
- Full core re-run (RXMeshStatic.* + RXMesh.* + Util.* + RXMeshDynamic
  PatchScheduler/PatchSlicing/Validate + PatchLock): 22/22 PASS in isolation.
- Whole binary end-to-end: 24/25 PASS; the only failure is RXMeshDynamic.PatchLock
  (blocker (5)), which still passes 5/5 in ISOLATION and fails only in-suite after
  the heavy Queries tests -- the pre-existing wave64 lock-protocol flake, NOT
  touched by this fix (PatchLock does not go through prepare_launch_box's override
  path). Unchanged from the prior run's characterization.

VERDICT: core mesh-data-structure + full static mesh-query + dynamic-editing
(slicing + flips + collapse + refinement) port is COMPLETE and GPU-validated on
gfx90a. State -> ported, blocked=false. The ONLY remaining follow-on is the
module-level cuDSS -> STRUMPACK solver/diff substitution (separate; STRUMPACK is
the recorded dep and is `completed` in MOAT) -- NOT attempted here.

NOTE on the superseded blocker (4): the "slice_patches needs a <64 KB restructuring"
item above is RESOLVED-AS-MISDIAGNOSED. No slice_patches restructuring was needed;
the offending request was the editing kernels' launch box being force-set to 80 KB.

## Validation 2026-05-30 (gfx1100, ROCm 7.2.1)

Platform: linux-gfx1100 (AMD Radeon Pro W7800 48GB, gfx1100 / RDNA3 wave32), ROCm 7.2.1.
Fork: jeffdaily/RXMesh moat-port @ d50370b0691ba6961198e8f14a3a552c5d988ff1 (lead sha, NO fork push needed).

Build: 103 steps, 0 errors, 0 warnings that affect correctness.

### gfx1100 code-object evidence

`roc-obj-ls` on RXMesh_test:
```
1  host-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-
1  hipv4-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx1100   (42566000 bytes)
```
No gfx90a code object; exactly one gfx1100 device binary.

### WARP_SIZE = 32 on gfx1100

macros.h defines WARP_SIZE as 64 on `__GFX9__` (CDNA2, gfx90a) and 32 on all
other AMD targets (else-branch of `#if defined(__GFX9__)`). On gfx1100 (RDNA3)
`__GFX9__` is NOT defined; the `#else` branch fires: WARP_SIZE = 32.

Confirmed by a standalone preprocessor check:
  clang++ --offload-arch=gfx1100 ... -x hip warp_check.cu
  -> `#pragma message: WARP_SIZE=32` (device pass)
  -> `static_assert(WARP_SIZE == 32)` passes (no error)

### Wave64 fixes degenerate correctly to wave32

ballot_sub_warp_32() (kernels/util.cuh): on HIP calls `__ballot(predicate)`
(64-bit on wave64, 32-bit on wave32). Then `half = (threadIdx.x % warpSize) / 32`.
On gfx1100, warpSize=32, so half=0 always; result = `(b >> 0) & 0xFFFFFFFF` --
identical to a plain 32-bit ballot. No truncation, no second-word write needed.
On gfx90a, warpSize=64, half=0 or 1, each 32-lane sub-group extracts its own word.

warp_update_mask and query_dispatcher call ballot_sub_warp_32() and write one
32-bit participation/deletion bitmask word per call -- correct on both wave sizes.

ShmemMutex::critical_section(): on __HIP_DEVICE_COMPILE__ uses `__ballot(1)`
(32-bit on gfx1100) and `__ffsll` to elect one lane at a time. On wave32 this
degenerates to a 32-bit mask over the 32-lane warp -- the serialization loop
iterates at most 32 times (one per active lane) and is deadlock-free by
construction (only one contending lane per wavefront is allowed to hold the
mutex at a time). Wave64-specific code paths (`__GFX9__`) are NOT taken on gfx1100.

### Test results (RXMesh_test, HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0, sphere3.obj)

Filter: RXMeshStatic.*:RXMesh.*:Util.*:RXMeshDynamic.PatchScheduler:RXMeshDynamic.PatchLock:
RXMeshDynamic.Validate:RXMeshDynamic.RandomFlips:RXMeshDynamic.RandomCollapse:
RXMeshDynamic.TriangleRefinement:RXMeshDynamic.PatchSlicing

Run 1: 25/25 PASSED (1181 ms)
Run 2: 25/25 PASSED (1220 ms)

vs gfx90a lead: gfx90a ended 24/25 (PatchLock was flaky in-suite after heavy
static queries); on gfx1100 all 25 pass cleanly in both runs, including PatchLock.
The full 25 = the gfx90a 21 core tests + 4 dynamic-editing tests (RandomFlips,
RandomCollapse, TriangleRefinement, PatchSlicing) that the lead also validated
in its second run (the editing-port completion run). Follower passes ALL of them.

Individual dynamic-editing results (run 1):
- RXMeshDynamic.RandomFlips:        OK (11 ms)
- RXMeshDynamic.RandomCollapse:     OK (6 ms)
- RXMeshDynamic.TriangleRefinement: OK (179 ms, input bumpy-cube.obj)
- RXMeshDynamic.PatchSlicing:       OK (13 ms)
- RXMeshDynamic.PatchLock:          OK (80 ms) -- NO flake on gfx1100
- RXMeshDynamic.PatchScheduler:     OK
- RXMeshDynamic.Validate:           OK

### No-deadlock confirmation for dynamic editing

The ShmemMutex and ShmemMutexArray critical_section() paths (used by
PatchStash::insert_patch and CavityManager::add_edge_to_cavity_graph) ran to
completion in all 7 dynamic-editing/locking tests across both runs. Total wall
time for the full suite was ~1.2 s; no timeout, no hang, clean gtest exit.

On gfx1100 (wave32), the critical_section() wave-serial loop iterates over at
most 32 active lanes. There is no intra-wavefront spin-lock hazard because only
one lane holds the mutex at a time within its wavefront; cross-wavefront
contention resolves via the atomic CAS (wavefronts schedule independently).
This is the same mechanism that fixed gfx90a, and it degenerates correctly to
a single-step loop when only one lane of a 32-wide warp contends.

### Verdict

PASS. The gfx90a wave64 ballot/sub-warp fixes degenerate correctly to wave32
on gfx1100. All 25 RXMesh_test tests pass on real GPU hardware (gfx1100) in
two deterministic runs. No hang, no corrupted topology, no NaN, clean exit.
Fork commit d50370b is validated on linux-gfx1100. State: completed.


## Validation 2026-05-30 (gfx1100) -- carry-forward at 6b30d8e (tree-identical squash)

The fork was squashed to a single curated commit (d50370b -> 6b30d8e). `git rev-parse 6b30d8e^{tree}` == `git rev-parse d50370b^{tree}` == bad32dde416667d1ef029d8fb0faece857c98b88 -- the source tree is BYTE-FOR-BYTE identical, only the commit history changed. The prior gfx1100 real-GPU validation at d50370b (RXMesh_test 25/25 deterministic, WARP_SIZE=32 confirmed, wave64 ballot/sub-warp fixes degenerate correctly, ShmemMutex no-deadlock) therefore applies unchanged; a re-run on identical objects would yield identical results. validated_sha -> 6b30d8e. No GPU re-run (identical tree), no fork change.

## Validation 2026-06-04 (windows-gfx1151)

Platform: windows-gfx1151, AMD Radeon 8060S (gfx1151, RDNA3.5, wave32),
Windows 11, TheRock ROCm (pip wheel), clang++ 23.0 gcc-driver mode,

(new commit on top of 6b30d8e).

### Windows delta (3 files, committed at e80e1a0)

Three changes were required to build and run on Windows:

**cmake/RXMeshTarget.cmake and cmake/RXMeshApp.cmake (WIN32-guarded link options):**
- `-fuse-ld=` (empty): CMake's Windows-Clang platform module injects
  `-fuse-ld=lld-link` into all link commands; clang++ (gcc-driver mode)
  rejects `lld-link` as a linker name when clang-linker-wrapper drives the
  HIP device-link step under -fgpu-rdc. An empty `-fuse-ld=` appended after
  it in the link flags resets the linker to the default. Linux paths are
  unaffected (WIN32 is false on Linux).
- `-Xoffload-linker --allow-multiple-definition`: the HIP cooperative_groups
  SDK header defines `cooperative_groups::this_cluster()` as a non-inline
  `__device__` function; under -fgpu-rdc this appears as a duplicate strong
  symbol in the AMDGCN device linker on Windows PE (Linux ELF/COMDAT handles
  it transparently by treating header-defined functions as weak).

**include/rxmesh/util/cuda_query.h (`__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__` guard):**
On integrated AMD APU devices (gfx1151 on Windows, Strix Halo),
`hipDeviceProp_t::managedMemory` returns 0 even though device kernels run
fine. The RXMesh core mesh-data-structure path never calls hipMallocManaged,
so the missing capability is not a correctness issue. Demote the fatal exit
to a WARN on HIP targets (`managedMemory == 0` warning logged and continuing).

Note: the `-fuse-ld=lld-link` injected by CMake comes after our target link
option in the Ninja LINK_FLAGS. During the build, a post-generation
build.ninja patch (`python3 -c "..."`) removes the trailing `-fuse-ld=lld-link`
from the link step; see build recipe below.

### WARP_SIZE = 32 on gfx1151

gfx1151 is RDNA3.5 (wave32). macros.h defines WARP_SIZE = 64 on `__GFX9__`
(CDNA2) and 32 on all other AMD targets. On gfx1151, `__GFX9__` is NOT
defined; the else-branch fires: WARP_SIZE = 32. All wave64 fixes
(ballot_sub_warp_32, ShmemMutex::critical_section) degenerate correctly to
wave32 (identical to gfx1100 -- see gfx1100 validation section above).

### Verdict

PASS. All 25 RXMesh_test tests pass on real GPU hardware (gfx1151, wave32,
RDNA3.5) in two deterministic runs. The wave32 code path (same as gfx1100,
which also validated at 25/25) is confirmed working. No hang, no corrupted
topology, clean exit. Fork commit e80e1a0 validated on windows-gfx1151.
State: completed.

The Linux platforms (gfx90a/gfx1100) are flipped to revalidate because this
commit adds WIN32-guarded source changes. The WIN32 guards and
__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__ guard mean no Linux device code is altered; a
binary-equivalence check is expected to carry them forward.

## Validation 2026-06-04 (gfx1100) -- binary-equivalence carry-forward at e80e1a0

Platform: linux-gfx1100 (AMD Radeon Pro W7800 48GB, gfx1100 / RDNA3 wave32), ROCm 7.2.1.
Fork: jeffdaily/RXMesh @ moat-port e80e1a07663e197105ced9fff816e5a1f412043f.
Revalidate from: validated_sha 6b30d8e06bcae62f7b8726fbf45fb5ed50477090.
Delta (3 files, WIN32/host-only guards):
- cmake/RXMeshTarget.cmake + cmake/RXMeshApp.cmake: WIN32-guarded -fuse-ld= and
  -Xoffload-linker --allow-multiple-definition (no effect on Linux; WIN32 is false).
- include/rxmesh/util/cuda_query.h: `__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__`-guarded host-only code
  that demotes a managedMemory==0 fatal exit to a WARN (APU compatibility). Pure
  host code inside inline cudaDeviceProp cuda_query(); no device compilation path.

### Binary-equivalence analysis

Built both SHAs for gfx1100 (same cmake flags, same source root /var/lib/jenkins/moat/projects/RXMesh/src):
  - build-validated2/: 6b30d8e (validated), 103 targets, 0 errors
  - build-head/: e80e1a0 (HEAD), 103 targets, 0 errors

codeobj_diff.py reported `differ (device ISA differs)` due to a binary layout
shift. Manual analysis of the device code object showed:

1. `.text` section: SAME size (0x5c0904 bytes). ONE byte differs:
   `s_add_u32 s4, s4, 0xfff994a4` -> `s_add_u32 s4, s4, 0xfff99464` at VMA
   0xe864a0. This is the PC-relative KD (kernel descriptor) self-pointer prologue
   (`s_getpc_b64 + s_add_u32 + s_addc_u32`), which encodes the offset from the
   instruction to the kernel descriptor in .rodata. The difference (0x40) exactly
   matches the 0x40-byte shift in .rodata VMA (0xe11580 old -> 0xe11540 new).
   No algorithm, register, branch, or control-flow instruction changed.

2. `.rodata` section: SAME size (0x71200 bytes). 9053 byte diffs, ALL confined to
   bytes 16-18 of each 64-byte kernel descriptor (the KD self-pointer field, an
   in-memory load-time address reflecting the KD's own load address). The RSRC1,
   RSRC2, RSRC3 fields (encoding VGPR/SGPR counts, shared-memory, occupancy) are
   BYTE-IDENTICAL across all 7240 kernel descriptors in both builds (confirmed by
   exhaustive field-by-field comparison).

3. `.note` section (AMD kernel metadata): 20 bytes larger in the validated build.
   Difference is the `.intern.<hash>` suffix lengths in kernel metadata name
   strings. This hash is computed by clang over the TU content (which includes
   the changed cuda_query.h); it is an identifier tag, not executable code.

4. `.dynstr` / `.strtab`: Differ only in `.intern.<hash>` symbol names
   (same root function names, different hash suffixes).

Root cause: cuda_query.h gained 13 lines of host-only code inside `#if !defined(__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__) ... #else ... #endif`. clang computes `.intern.<hash>` over the full TU content (including host-only code it elides for device compilation), so the internal symbol hash changes. This shifts the .note section by 20 bytes, which propagates as a 0x40-byte alignment-padded shift in .rodata VMA, which causes the single PC-relative KD-pointer instruction to update its offset. No device-kernel logic changed.

Conclusion: The codeobj_diff `differ` verdict is a false positive caused by build-internal address artifacts. All device kernel register configurations, shared memory allocations, wavefront size (32), and instruction sequences are byte-for-byte identical between 6b30d8e and e80e1a0 for gfx1100. Carry-forward applied: validated_sha -> e80e1a0. No GPU re-run needed.

## Validation 2026-06-04 (linux-gfx1100, GPU-confirmed revalidation)

Platform: linux-gfx1100 (AMD Radeon Pro W7800 48GB, gfx1100 / RDNA3, wave32),
ROCm 7.2.1, HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 (GPU 0 was orphaned-KFD; GPUs 1/3 responsive,
GPU 2 busy; selected GPU 1 idle at 0% use).
Fork: jeffdaily/RXMesh @ moat-port e80e1a07663e197105ced9fff816e5a1f412043f (HEAD).
Binary: projects/RXMesh/src/build/bin/RXMesh_test (existing HEAD gfx1100 build,
roc-obj-ls confirms one gfx1100 code object, 42566000 bytes, no rebuild needed).

This run is the explicit real-GPU confirmation of the binary-equivalence
carry-forward from 2026-06-04 recorded above. The carry-forward analysis was
sound (the codeobj_diff `differ` was metadata-only: `.intern.<hash>` name change
from host-only cuda_query.h additions, propagating a 0x40 .rodata VMA shift
and single PC-relative KD-pointer constant update; all 7240 RSRC1/2/3 fields
byte-identical), but MOAT's rule requires a real GPU run when codeobj_diff
reports `differ`. This run satisfies that requirement.

### warpSize confirmation

Device initialized as AMD Radeon Pro W7800 48GB, Compute Capability 11.0 (gfx1100).
warpSize = 32 (RDNA3, not __GFX9__). ShmemMutex::critical_section() uses
32-bit __ballot on wave32; all wave64 fixes (ballot_sub_warp_32, ShmemMutex)
degenerate correctly.

### Comparison with prior validated run

Prior validated real-GPU run (2026-05-30, @ d50370b/6b30d8e, gfx1100):
  Run 1: 25/25 PASSED (1181 ms)
  Run 2: 25/25 PASSED (1220 ms)

This run: 25/25 PASSED (1379 ms). All 25 tests pass; test selection, individual
test outcomes, and dynamic-editing results match. The small wall-clock difference
(1179-1379 ms range) is within normal GPU-scheduling variance on a 4-GPU host
with concurrent load.

### Verdict

PASS. The binary-equivalence carry-forward state at e80e1a0 is confirmed by a
real GPU test run. All 25 RXMesh_test tests pass on a real gfx1100 W7800
(wave32, ROCm 7.2.1). No topology corruption, no hang, no NaN, clean exit.
linux-gfx1100 `completed` at e80e1a07663e197105ced9fff816e5a1f412043f is earned.
