# projects/

One folder per adopted upstream project. The folder is NOT a git submodule; it holds only MOAT tracking artifacts. The real port lives in the project's jeffdaily fork, cloned (gitignored) into `src/`.

Per-project files:

- `status.json` -- per-platform state machine; the source of truth. Schema in `../schema/status.schema.json`. Semantic-merged across CLIs (see `../.gitattributes`).
- `upstream.json` -- upstream URL, default branch, fork URL, `ext_type` (cmake | torch-extension), base SHA for deterministic re-clone.
- `plan.md` -- planner output: build classification, port strategy, CUDA-surface inventory, risk list, file-by-file change list, build + GPU test plan.
- `notes.md` -- project-specific gotchas, review records, validation records. Append-only with dated headings.
- `stats.jsonl` -- append-only phase wall-clock, session, and token records.
- `src/` -- gitignored clone of the jeffdaily fork (the porter's working tree).
- `.lock` / `.claim` -- gitignored same-host claim + heartbeat for race protection.

Scaffold a new project with `utils/moatlib.py` (`scaffold_project`) after adopting a row from `data/candidates.json`.
