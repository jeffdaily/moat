# QUICK notes

## Port Summary

QUICK is a quantum chemistry package with existing authoritative HIP support from the original developers (Merz/Goetz labs at UCSD/MSU, published in J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2023). The HIP code was disabled due to ROCm 5.4.3-6.2.0 compiler bugs; ROCm 6.2.1+ fixes those bugs.

The port was a validate-and-improve effort, not from-scratch:
1. Removed the configure script HIP exit block
2. Fixed hipcc path detection for ROCm 7.x ($ROCM_PATH/bin vs $ROCM_PATH/hip/bin)
3. Added missing C++ standard library includes for HIP compilation

## Build Instructions

```bash
export ROCM_PATH=/opt/rocm
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DHIP=ON -DCOMPILER=GNU -DQUICK_USER_ARCH=gfx90a -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j16
make install DESTDIR=$PWD/../install
```

## Test Instructions

```bash
export QUICK_HOME=/path/to/install/usr/local
export QUICK_BASIS=$QUICK_HOME/basis
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QUICK_HOME/lib:/opt/rocm/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
cd $QUICK_HOME
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 ./runtest --hip --ene
```

## Validation Results (gfx90a)

- ene_acetone_rhf_321g: PASSED (TOTAL ENERGY = -190.882196695 vs ref -190.882196697, 2 microhartree agreement)
- ene_psb5_rhf_631g: PASSED (from runtest)

Note: PSB5 with 631gss basis takes >30 minutes on gfx90a, which is expected for this computationally intensive calculation.

## Known Issues

- Issue #433 reports 3x performance regression vs AmberTools23 QUICK on some systems; root cause investigation pending

## Review 2026-06-05

**Verdict: APPROVED**

Reviewed moat-port branch (c5f108e) vs master (bc80f98).

### Summary

Minimal validate-and-improve port re-enabling existing authoritative HIP support. 3 files changed, +13/-7 lines. Changes:
- configure: removed HIP exit block, fixed hipcc path detection for ROCm 7.x (hipcc moved from $ROCM_PATH/hip/bin to $ROCM_PATH/bin)
- src/gpu/hip/gpu.cu, src/gpu/hip/gpu_utils.h: added <cstring>, <cstdlib>, <cctype> includes required by HIP/clang (nvcc implicitly includes these)

### Fault Class Verification

- **Warp size**: No warp primitives (__shfl, __ballot, __activemask, etc.) in HIP sources. ERI_GRAD_FFFF_TPB=32 is threads-per-block, not warp-size -- works on both wave64 and wave32. Code is warp-agnostic.
- **Rule-of-five**: No texture/resource handles added or modified by this port.
- **OOB neighbor reads**: Not applicable (no neighbor reads in changed code).
- **256B texture pitch**: Texture code exists but is unchanged upstream code.
- **Library swaps**: None required; upstream already uses rocBLAS/rocSOLVER.

### Build System

CMake HIP support is upstream authoritative with proper version guards (blocks ROCm 5.4.3-6.2.0 due to known compiler bugs). No build system changes in this port.

### Commit Hygiene

- Title: `[ROCm] Re-enable HIP support for ROCm 7.x` (48 chars, proper prefix)
- Body: explains changes, credits Claude, includes Test Plan
- No noreply trailer
- Author: jeffdaily (correct)

### Test Coverage

Porter ran 2 tests (acetone RHF/3-21G, psb5 RHF/6-31G) with 2 microhartree agreement. Adequate for review gate; validator will run full test suite (205 input files).

No issues found.
