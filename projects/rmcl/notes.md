# rmcl notes

rmcl's portable GPU compute IS rmagine's CUDA backend, so the substantive ROCm
port lives on a **jeffdaily/rmagine** fork and rmcl stays the named MOAT project
tracking it. rmcl wants rmagine 2.4-2.5.0; the fork is branched off upstream
rmagine main (v2.4.2), which is in range.

## Fork / dependency

- Fork: https://github.com/jeffdaily/rmagine  (branch `moat-port`, off upstream main 6b93e86)
- Validated rmagine commit (Stage 1): pin rmcl's source_dependencies.yaml to the
  moat-port HEAD recorded in status.json `head_sha`.
- Actions disabled on the fork.
- rmcl itself was NOT modified this run (its rmcl_ros .cu + ROS 2 layer is a
  separate milestone, see "Deferred").

## Stage 1 delivered: rmagine::cuda HIP compute backend (gfx90a, validated)

Strategy A (compat header + LANGUAGE HIP) behind a new top-level `USE_HIP`
option. NVIDIA build byte-identical when USE_HIP=OFF.

Key pieces:
- NEW `src/rmagine_cuda/include/rmagine/util/cuda/cuda_to_hip.h` -- single compat
  shim mapping the ~30 cuda runtime + cuCtx driver + curand device symbols used
  to hip/hiprand spellings. Included in place of `<cuda_runtime.h>`/`<cuda.h>`/
  `<curand*.h>` at every rmagine_cuda TU (11 redirected include lines + the
  math_svd test). Force-included on HIP TUs via `CMAKE_HIP_FLAGS -include`.
- `src/rmagine_cuda/CMakeLists.txt` -- USE_HIP branch: enable_language(HIP),
  LANGUAGE HIP on RMAGINE_CUDA_SRCS, `-fgpu-rdc` + `--hip-link` for the cross-TU
  `__device__` svd/umeyama_transform calls (CUDA used CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION),
  link hip::host + hip::hiprand (hip::device PRIVATE so the --offload-arch flag
  does not leak to plain-C++ consumers), drop the cublas/cusolver link refs (no
  call sites), default CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx90a only when unset.

### Wave-size hardening: warp-synchronous reduction tail (USE_HIP-guarded)
`statistics.cu` sum_kernel, the four `math_batched.cu` chunk_sums kernels, and
`memory_math.cu` cov_kernel<1024> / sum_kernel<1024> ran the `__syncthreads`
tree only to s>32, then a 32-lane `volatile` warpReduce tail with no
`__syncwarp`. That tail assumes a 32-lane lockstep wavefront. On gfx90a a
64-lane wavefront executes the low 32 lanes in lockstep in practice, so this is
NOT observed to miscompute on this hardware today (the reviewer's covtest and
this run's new asserting test both show ~1e-9..1e-4 rel match to a CPU
reference and bit-identical results run-to-run). The fix is wave-size
hardening, not a reproduced-corruption fix: the unsynchronized tail is not
guaranteed correct on a 64-lane wave. Fix (USE_HIP-guarded, CUDA byte-identical):
drop the warp tail, run the full block-wide `__syncthreads` tree to s>0. Applied
consistently to every warp-tail reduction in the exported reduction API
(rm::sum / rm::mean / rm::cov / sumBatched). The statistics_p2p/p2l/
objectwise_p2l kernels already ran the full tree (s>0), so they needed no change.

DEAD CODE: `statistics.cu:17 sum_kernel<blockSize,T>` has zero callers and is
not declared in any header. The load-bearing reductions are `memory_math.cu`
sum_kernel<1024> (backs rm::sum/rm::mean) and cov_kernel<1024> (backs rm::cov),
plus the math_batched chunk_sums set (backs sumBatched). The statistics.cu
sum_kernel was annotated as unused in-source and hardened only so all warp-tail
reductions in that TU read consistently; its fix is not functionally
load-bearing. `sum_kernel_test` (memory_math.cu) already ran the full s>0 tree
with no warp tail, so it needed no change.

### THE actually-decisive AMD fix: NaN-seed in the reduction kernels
The reduction kernels seeded shared memory with `sdata[tid] *= 0.0`, which reads
uninitialized LDS first. On AMD that garbage is routinely NaN/Inf and survives
the multiply (nan*0 = nan), poisoning the sum: rm::sum / rm::mean over Vector
and sumBatched returned NaN on gfx90a. (This is the hazard the plan flagged; the
reviewer's covtest got lucky LDS and did not hit it because cov_kernel uses
setZeros(), and rm::sum<int> cannot NaN.) Fix (unconditional -- UB on CUDA too):
seed each lane with a true typed zero `data[0] - data[0]` before accumulating.
The new asserting test (below) is what surfaced this.

### Two more AMD-surfaced bugs (also UB on CUDA, fixed unconditionally)
- `memory_math.cu` multNx1(Quaternion,Quaternion) called multNxN_kernel, which
  reads `b[id]` for id<N off a size-1 buffer; the Transform/Matrix3x3 siblings
  already use multNx1_kernel (reads `b[0]`). CUDA tolerated the OOB read; AMD
  faults (cuda_math memory access fault). Switched to multNx1_kernel.
- `shared_functions.h` keyed RMAGINE_FUNCTION on `__CUDA_ARCH__` (device pass
  only). HIP/clang then saw the shared math/memory helpers as host-only when
  device code called them and rejected the decl/def attribute mismatch. Re-keyed
  on `__CUDACC__`/`__HIPCC__` (defined in BOTH passes on each toolchain); a plain
  g++ build defines neither, so the CPU path is unchanged. `MemoryView::raw`
  definitions in Memory.tcc got the matching RMAGINE_FUNCTION.

### CudaContext
`cuCtxSetSharedMemConfig`/`cuCtxGetSharedMemConfig`/`CU_SHARED_MEM_CONFIG_*`
USE_HIP-guarded out (CDNA has no configurable LDS bank width). The rest of the
driver context API maps 1:1 to hipCtx*; `hipCtxCreate(&ctx, 0, dev)` matches the
pre-CUDA-13 `cuCtxCreate` form taken when CUDA_VERSION is undefined under HIP.

## Build recipe (gfx90a; standalone, no ROS/Embree/Vulkan/OptiX)

```
cd projects/rmcl/rmagine_src   # jeffdaily/rmagine @ moat-port
export HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1   # this host: GCD 1 only (others busy)
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_HIP=ON \
  -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx90a -DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++ \
  -DRMAGINE_EMBREE_DISABLE=ON -DRMAGINE_OPTIX_DISABLE=ON \
  -DRMAGINE_VULKAN_DISABLE=ON -DRMAGINE_VULKAN_CUDA_INTEROP_DISABLE=ON \
  -DRMAGINE_OUSTER_DISABLE=ON -DRMAGINE_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DRMAGINE_BUILD_TOOLS=OFF
cmake --build build -j
```
Followers: same command, only change `-DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx1100` (or
gfx1151). No source change -- the wave64 fix (full __syncthreads tree) is
wave-agnostic and correct on wave32 too. Deps: ROCm 7.2, Eigen3, TBB, Boost,
assimp (apt: libboost-all-dev libassimp-dev).

## Validation (real gfx90a / MI250X, GCD 1, HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1) -- PASS

```
cd build && ctest --output-on-failure -R '^cuda_'   # 7/7 PASS
ctest --output-on-failure -R '^core_'               # 12/12 PASS (host unchanged)
```
- cuda_math, cuda_memory, cuda_memory_slicing, cuda_math_svd,
  cuda_math_statistics, cuda_math_reduction, cuda_math_reduction_correctness
  all PASS.
- NEW asserting gate `cuda_math_reduction_correctness`
  (tests/cuda/math_reduction_correctness.cpp): computes rm::sum / rm::mean /
  rm::cov over 4099 (non-power-of-two) Vector pairs, compares each component to
  a double-precision CPU reference to ~1e-4 rel (throws on mismatch/NaN), and
  asserts the GPU result is bit-identical across two runs. This is the real
  correctness/determinism gate for the reduction hardening + NaN-seed fix; the
  pre-existing cuda_math* tests only PRINT their reduction outputs (no assert),
  so they did not gate the reductions. Confirmed via AMD_LOG_LEVEL=3 that it
  dispatches the fixed sum_kernel<1024> and cov_kernel<1024> on MI250X.
- Before the NaN-seed fix this test FAILED with `sum = -nan` (and cuda_math
  sumBatched printed nan), proving the `*= 0.0` LDS-seed bug was real on AMD.
- hipRAND is not bitwise-identical to cuRAND (expected); the noise/random paths
  are validated statistically, not bitwise.
- Build dir for this run: agent_space/rmcl_build (scratch, gitignored). GCD 1
  only (HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1).

### Gotchas (for followers / future passes)
- The compat header comment must not contain a literal end-of-comment marker
  inside a block comment (`cuda*` then `/curand*` closed the comment early ->
  bogus parse errors). Spell symbol globs out in prose.
- `-fgpu-rdc` is required: svd/umeyama_transform are cross-TU `__device__`
  functions; without it the device link fails with undefined hidden symbols.
- hip::device must be PRIVATE on the lib or `--offload-arch=gfx90a` leaks onto
  the plain-C++ test compiles (g++ rejects it).
- hiprand cmake target is `hip::hiprand`, not bare `hiprand` (-> `-lhiprand` not
  found).
- `timeit.sh` cd's to the MOAT repo root, so pass an ABSOLUTE build dir to the
  wrapped cmake/ctest command.

## Deferred (this host / scope)

- rmcl-layer milestone (rmcl_ros particle_motion.cu + resampling.cu + the MICP
  CUDA sensors + ROS 2 nodes): needs ROS 2 jazzy + Embree, not on this host. The
  two .cu are trivial (curand->hiprand; resampling's reduction already runs the
  full __syncthreads tree, wave-safe). Build them through rmagine's HIP toolchain
  in a colcon workspace once ROS 2 + Embree are provisioned. Not a blocker for
  the rmagine_cuda deliverable.

## Stage 2 (OptiX->HIPRT MCL backend) -- IN PROGRESS

The Monte-Carlo / global-localization GPU path is NVIDIA-OptiX-gated and is a
separate HIPRT reimplementation stage, to be done AFTER EnvGS Stage 2 lands and
proves the HIPRT pattern on this host. EnvGS Stage 2 is now complete (validated
on gfx90a and gfx1100), so Stage 2 is unblocked.

### Stage 2 Pinhole proof-of-concept COMPLETED (2026-06-05)

Implemented and validated rmagine_hiprt Pinhole ray-tracing backend. Fork HEAD
4d2cd26 @ moat-port.

Structure:
- `include/rmagine/util/hiprt/HiprtContext.hpp` -- HIPRT context wrapper
- `include/rmagine/map/hiprt/HiprtMesh.hpp` -- triangle mesh for HIPRT
- `include/rmagine/map/hiprt/HiprtScene.hpp` -- scene/BVH management
- `include/rmagine/simulation/hiprt/sim_program_data.h` -- kernel data structs
- `include/rmagine/simulation/PinholeSimulatorHiprt.hpp` -- Pinhole simulator
- Implementation files in `src/util/`, `src/map/`, `src/simulation/`
- CMakeLists.txt wiring (USE_HIP-gated, requires HIPRT_PATH)

Key mapping (OptiX -> HIPRT):
- optixAccelBuild (triangle GAS) -> hiprtCreateGeometry + hiprtBuildGeometry
- raygen/closesthit/miss programs -> single HIP kernel (embedded source, JIT)
- optixTrace -> hiprtGeomTraversalClosest + getNextHit()
- SBT records -> HiprtMeshData structs passed as kernel args
- launch params -> kernel args (PinholeTraceParams)
- optixModuleCreate -> hiprtBuildTraceKernels (JIT, cached)
- optixLaunch -> hipModuleLaunchKernel (HIP driver API)

Implementation notes:
- Kernel source is embedded as a C++ raw string literal (not a separate file)
  because hiprtBuildTraceKernels takes source, not a file path
- BVH build requires temp buffer from hiprtGetGeometryBuildTemporaryBufferSize
- HIPRT module lifecycle managed by HIPRT's JIT cache (not manually unloaded)
- PinholeModelDev struct layout must match rmagine::PinholeModel exactly:
  width, height, range{min,max}, f[2], c[2]
- Transform3f uses Quaternionf{x,y,z,w} + Vector3f{x,y,z} (matches rmagine)

Validated on gfx90a (MI250X, ROCm 7.2.1):
- Test harness (agent_space/rmcl_hiprt_test/test_pinhole) traces 8x8 rays from
  a Pinhole camera against a 2x2 quad at z=2
- Center pixel reports range=2.0 (exact)
- 25/64 rays hit the quad (correct given FOV/geometry)
- Stage 1 rmagine_cuda tests 7/7 PASS (no regression)

Remaining Stage 2 work:
- Spherical/O1Dn/OnDn sensor simulators (same pattern, different ray generation)
- Multi-mesh scene support (current impl merges meshes into one geometry)
- Face normals computation (currently not used)
- Integration with rmcl's MCL localization path

Original scope:
- rmagine ships an OptiX ray-mesh-intersection backend (rmagine_optix:
  optixAccelBuild / optixTrace / module+SBT+pipeline, ~43 OptiX symbols across
  ~60 files). rmcl's RCCOptix + rmcl_ros optix BeamEvaluateProgram
  (__raygen__/__closesthit__/__miss__ PTX) + PCDSensorUpdaterOptix +
  rmcl_localization build only `if(RMCL_OPTIX AND RMCL_EMBREE)`.
- Plan: reimplement rmagine's OptiX ray-mesh backend against AMD HIPRT (the
  EnvGS Stage 2 path + agent_space/hiprt_probe/ are the reference), so the
  rmcl_localization Monte-Carlo node gets an AMD GPU ray-casting backend. Build
  the BVH with HIPRT, port the per-beam likelihood raygen/closesthit/miss to a
  HIPRT trace kernel, and feed the result into the existing rmcl correspondence /
  statistics compute (already HIP-validated in Stage 1).
- HIPRT is NOT in ROCm 7.2 (only hiprtc); needs the HIPRT SDK. Greenlit by jeff
  (OptiX->HIPRT) but explicitly NOT in scope this run.
- The Vulkan RT backend (cross-vendor) is a separate deferral: no Vulkan SDK on
  this host.

## Review 2026-06-01 (reviewer, linux-gfx90a) -- CHANGES REQUESTED

Reviewed moat-port HEAD 100e713 vs upstream merge-base 6b93e86 in
projects/rmcl/rmagine_src. Stage 1 (rmagine::cuda compute port) only; Stage 2
(OptiX->HIPRT MCL backend) is a separate future stage and was not in scope.
Built fresh in agent_space and ran the suites on real gfx90a (GCD 1,
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1): ctest -R '^cuda_' = 6/6 PASS, ctest -R '^core_' = 12/12
PASS, reproducing the porter's result. The build, the Strategy-A compat-header
approach, the CMake gating, the NVIDIA-path guarding, and commit hygiene are all
sound. The problems below are about the central wave64 correctness narrative and
the inconsistency / dead-targeting of the reduction fix, plus inaccurate
test-evidence claims. They are fixable by either completing the fix or correcting
the analysis.

### 1. The wave64 warp-tail fix is applied to 5 kernels but the identical pattern is left, unguarded, in three publicly-exported kernels

The same `s > 32` tree + unsynced `volatile warpReduce<...>` tail that was
USE_HIP-guarded out of statistics.cu sum_kernel and the four math_batched.cu
chunk_sums kernels still runs verbatim -- on BOTH the HIP and CUDA paths -- in:
- src/rmagine_cuda/src/math/memory_math.cu:447-459 `cov_kernel<blockSize>`,
  launched as `cov_kernel<1024>` by the public `rm::cov()` (memory_math.cu:1552)
  and reached by `rm::mean`-adjacent covariance use.
- src/rmagine_cuda/src/math/memory_math.cu:1450-1464 `sum_kernel<nMemElems>`,
  launched as `sum_kernel<1024>` by the public `rm::sum()` (memory_math.cu:1496,
  1515) and therefore by `rm::mean()` (memory_math.cu:1528-1533).
- src/rmagine_cuda/src/math/memory_math.cu:1745 `sum_kernel_test` (the
  reduction-test kernel `rm::sum_reduce_test_t4` dispatches).

If the porter's stated root cause is correct (the tail "races and yields
wrong/nondeterministic sums" on wave64), then leaving it in the exported
covariance/sum/mean API is a real defect: rmcl's correspondence path consumes
exactly these statistics. Fix these three the same way (full `__syncthreads`
tree to s>0, USE_HIP-guarded), or explain why they are exempt.

### 2. The stated severity of the wave64 bug is not reproducible on gfx90a -- the analysis is overstated

I built two focused harnesses (agent_space/covtest/) against the as-shipped
libraries and ran them on gfx90a (GCD 1):
- `rm::cov()` over 4000 non-trivial Vector pairs (cov_kernel<1024>, the UNFIXED
  warp tail): GPU result matches a CPU double reference to ~1e-9 relative error
  and is bit-identical across 8 runs (0 run-to-run mismatches).
- `rm::sumBatched()` (the FIXED chunk_sums path): correct to ~7e-10 rel and
  bit-identical across 8 runs.
- `rm::sum()` over 20.7M ints (sum_kernel<1024>, UNFIXED): correct
  (20736000) and identical across 5 runs.

So on this hardware the warp-synchronous tail produces correct, deterministic
results (a wave64 executes lockstep and the `volatile` accesses order the LDS
reads/writes). The "WRONG / NaN / garbage covariance / run-to-run
nondeterministic" framing in the commit body and in notes.md "Root cause" is not
empirically supported here. The fix is defensible as spec-compliance / future
wave-size safety, but the notes and commit message should be re-scoped to say
that rather than asserting an observed miscompute/nondeterminism that the tests
do not actually exhibit. (If the porter did observe a failure, attach the
reproducer; I could not reproduce one.)

### 3. The headline-fixed kernel (statistics.cu sum_kernel) is dead code

src/rmagine_cuda/src/math/statistics.cu:17 `sum_kernel<blockSize,T>` has zero
callers anywhere in src/ or tests/ and is not declared in statistics.cuh /
statistics.h. The USE_HIP fix at statistics.cu:38-67 therefore validates nothing
and the "decisive fix" lands on an unused symbol. The real statistics path is
`statistics_p2p/p2l/objectwise_p2l`, which already ran the full tree (s>0) and
were correctly left unchanged. Either drop the dead kernel or note that the
load-bearing reduction fix is actually the math_batched chunk_sums set, not
statistics.cu sum_kernel.

### 4. Test-evidence claims in the commit body and notes are inaccurate

The commit body and notes say "cuda_math_reduction and cuda_math_statistics
dispatch the fixed sum_kernel / statistics kernels and assert no NaN ... two runs
of cuda_math_statistics are bit-identical." In fact:
- tests/cuda/math_statistics.cpp main() (line 181-199) runs only `test_sum()`,
  which calls `rm::sum` (the UNFIXED memory_math.cu sum_kernel), prints
  `total == size`, and does NOT call `checkStats` -- no assertion at all; the
  test passes regardless of the value. Its "determinism" is trivial (one fixed
  scalar sum).
- tests/cuda/math_reduction.cpp main() (line 206) runs only `test_sum_2()`,
  which calls `sum_reduce_test_t4` (sum_kernel_test) and only prints; the
  `checkStats` / `statistics_p2p` calls are in commented-out test1/test2.
- The fixed chunk_sums kernels are actually exercised by `cuda_math`
  (tests/cuda/math.cpp:402-499 sumBatched scalar/vector/matrix), but that block
  also only prints -- no EXPECT/ASSERT on the summed values.
So no running test asserts numeric correctness of any fixed reduction. The one
genuine assertion-by-crash is the multNx1 fault fix (see below), exercised by
cuda_math multNx1(Q,Q1,Q) at math.cpp:160. Re-scope the test-plan prose to what
the tests actually check, or add an assertion (EXPECT-style) on a sumBatched /
cov result against a CPU reference so the reduction fix has a real gate.

### Verified correct (no action)
- multNx1(Quaternion) OOB fix (memory_math.cu:619): switching multNxN_kernel ->
  multNx1_kernel is correct (multNx1_kernel reads b[0], memory_math.cu:54),
  matches the Transform/Matrix3x3 siblings, and is genuinely validated -- the
  pre-fix OOB faulted cuda_math, which now passes on gfx90a.
- shared_functions.h __CUDA_ARCH__ -> __CUDACC__/__HIPCC__ re-key
  (shared_functions.h:50) and the matching Memory.tcc raw() RMAGINE_FUNCTION
  (Memory.tcc:58,63): plain g++ defines neither macro so the CPU path is
  unchanged; core_ tests 12/12 PASS confirm the host path is intact.
- cuda_to_hip.h symbol surface, the CudaContext cuCtx* mapping with
  cuCtxSetSharedMemConfig/GetSharedMemConfig USE_HIP-guarded out, and the
  hipCtxCreate(&ctx,0,dev) form (CUDA_VERSION undefined under HIP -> pre-13
  branch at CudaContext.cpp:44) are correct. cuRAND->hipRAND validated
  statistically, not bitwise (correct bar).
- CrossStatistics zero-seed `sdata[tid] *= 0.0` is a true zero (statistics
  reductions produce no NaN; core/cuda statistics tests pass).
- Strategy A, USE_HIP default OFF, enable_language(HIP), -fgpu-rdc/--hip-link,
  hip::device PRIVATE, default gfx90a only when unset: all correct and minimal.
- Commit hygiene: [ROCm] title 65 chars, Claude disclosed, no noreply/coauthor/
  ghstack/em-dash; fork origin/main == upstream 6b93e86 (clean mirror); fork
  Actions disabled. No AMD-internal account references.

### Porter response 2026-06-01 (re-review, HEAD 3d098d5) -- all 4 items addressed
1. Wave-tail hardening extended to the three exported kernels: cov_kernel<1024>
   and sum_kernel<1024> (memory_math.cu) now USE_HIP-guarded full-tree like the
   other five. sum_kernel_test was ALREADY full-tree (s>0, no warpReduce) so it
   needed no change (reviewer line-number was approximate).
2. Re-scoped all prose (commit body + notes "Wave-size hardening" + the in-source
   comments in statistics.cu/math_batched.cu/memory_math.cu) from
   "races/WRONG/NaN/nondeterministic" to "wave-size hardening: removes an
   unsynchronized-warp-tail assumption not guaranteed on a 64-lane wave; not
   observed to miscompute on gfx90a today." Honest.
3. statistics.cu sum_kernel annotated in-source as unused/dead (zero callers, no
   header decl); notes "DEAD CODE" paragraph added. Its fix is not load-bearing.
4. Added tests/cuda/math_reduction_correctness.cpp -- an ASSERTING gate on
   rm::sum/mean/cov vs a CPU double reference + 2-run determinism. Wired into
   ctest (cuda_math_reduction_correctness). Running it surfaced a REAL
   AMD-specific NaN-seed bug (`sdata[tid] *= 0.0` on uninitialized LDS) that the
   reviewer's covtest missed; fixed unconditionally with a true typed zero
   (data[0]-data[0]) in sum_kernel + the four chunk_sums kernels. multNx1 OOB
   fix and shared_functions.h macro fix left as-is (reviewer confirmed correct).
Re-validated on gfx90a (GCD 1): cuda_ 7/7 PASS, core_ 12/12 PASS.

### Required before re-review
Address items 1-4: either (a) extend the USE_HIP-guarded full-tree fix to
cov_kernel<1024>, sum_kernel<1024> (int+Vector), and sum_kernel_test for
consistency across the exported reduction API, and add at least one
correctness-asserting GPU check (sumBatched or cov vs CPU reference); or (b) if
the warp tail is intentionally left as benign-on-CDNA, correct the commit
message and notes to state that the fix is spec/wave-size hardening (not an
observed miscompute), justify why the unguarded exported kernels are acceptable,
and remove or annotate the dead statistics.cu sum_kernel. The functional port is
otherwise GPU-clean on gfx90a.

## Review 2026-06-01 (reviewer DELTA re-review, linux-gfx90a) -- REVIEW PASSED

Focused delta re-review of 100e713 -> 3d098d5 (5 files: math_batched.cu,
memory_math.cu, statistics.cu, tests/cuda/CMakeLists.txt + the new
tests/cuda/math_reduction_correctness.cpp). The compat header, multNx1 OOB fix,
__CUDACC__/__HIPCC__ re-key, and commit hygiene were cleared in the prior pass
and are unchanged in the delta. Rebuilt fresh in agent_space and ran on real
gfx90a (GCD 1, HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1): ctest -R '^cuda_' = 7/7 PASS (incl. the
new cuda_math_reduction_correctness), ctest -R '^core_' = 12/12 PASS.

All four prior findings resolved; the NaN-seed fix it surfaced is correct.

1. Wave-tail hardening now consistent across the exported reduction API. The
   USE_HIP-guarded full-`__syncthreads`-tree-to-s>0 form is applied to
   cov_kernel<1024> (memory_math.cu:447-474, backs rm::cov) and sum_kernel<1024>
   (memory_math.cu:1470-1501, backs rm::sum/rm::mean) with the CUDA s>32 +
   warpReduce tail preserved in the #else. No exported warp-tail reduction
   remains unguarded. sum_kernel_test was already a full s>0 tree (no warp tail),
   confirmed -- the prior review's line number was approximate; nothing to change
   there. CUDA path is byte-identical (the new code is strictly inside the
   USE_HIP/`__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__` branch).

2. Prose re-scoped honestly. The commit body, the notes "Wave-size hardening"
   paragraph, and the in-source comments (statistics.cu:42-49,
   memory_math.cu:448-451 / 1471-1474, math_batched.cu x4) now describe an
   unsynchronized-warp-tail assumption not guaranteed on a 64-lane wave, "not
   observed to miscompute on gfx90a today" -- no false claim of reproduced
   corruption/nondeterminism.

3. Dead code annotated. statistics.cu:16-20 marks sum_kernel as unused (no
   callers, no header decl) and points to the load-bearing memory_math.cu
   kernels.

4. Real asserting test. math_reduction_correctness.cpp builds 4099 (non-power-of-
   two) Vector pairs, runs rm::sum/rm::mean/rm::cov, and check_rel() THROWS
   (uncaught -> non-zero exit -> ctest fail) on >1e-4 rel error or on NaN
   (`got != got`); the determinism block uses exact `==` across two runs. It
   genuinely gates the fixed sum_kernel<1024>/cov_kernel<1024> (porter confirmed
   dispatch via AMD_LOG_LEVEL=3, and the test failed with -nan before the seed
   fix). This is a real assert, not print-only.

5. NaN-seed fix verified correct. `sdata[tid] *= 0.0` (read of uninitialized LDS,
   NaN/Inf-prone on AMD) replaced by a true typed zero `sdata[tid] = data[0];
   sdata[tid] -= data[0];` at every prior `*= 0.0` site: sum_kernel
   (memory_math.cu:1458-1459) and all four chunk_sums kernels (math_batched.cu).
   Vector is Vector3_<float> with operator-= (Vector3.hpp:214), int trivially, so
   data[0]-data[0] is a correct component-wise zero for every reduced type.
   cov_kernel never had the bug (it seeds via setZeros(), memory_math.cu:427) and
   correctly was not touched by the seed change. The fix is unconditional (the
   `*= 0.0` was UB on CUDA too) and does not alter CUDA numerics (a true zero is
   what `*= 0.0` was always intended to produce).

Minor (non-blocking, no action): the new seed reads `data[0]` unconditionally on
every lane, so an empty reduction (N==0) would read OOB where the old `*= 0.0`
did not dereference data. This path was already meaningless under the old code
(the accumulate loop ran zero times and returned uninitialized LDS), no
in-tree/rmcl caller passes an empty buffer, and the in-source comment scopes the
guarantee to "non-empty reduction input." Acceptable; flagging only for a future
hardening pass.

Verdict: clean. Stage 2 (OptiX->HIPRT) remains out of scope. Handing to the
validator.

Test exits with: `PASS: rm::sum/mean/cov match CPU reference and are deterministic`

### Wave32 verdict

The full-`__syncthreads`-tree-to-s>0 reduction (USE_HIP-guarded) is correct on the
32-lane wavefront of gfx1100. With wave32 the original warp-tail concern is even
sharper (only 32 lanes execute in lockstep, not 64), but the fix runs the
complete block-wide tree so no warp-synchronous tail is exercised at all. No
leftover unsynchronized warp tail remains in the HIP path. No HSA 0x1016, no HIP
error, no NaN, no hang. Results match the CPU reference within documented
tolerance (~1e-4 rel) and are bit-identical run-to-run. Matches gfx90a@3d098d5.

No source change from the gfx90a-validated HEAD (follower validate-first; no
delta port needed).

## Validation 2026-06-05 (linux-gfx1100 REVALIDATE, HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0) -- PASS

Revalidation after HEAD moved from 3d098d5 (Stage 1 only) to db7f064 (Stage 1 + Stage 2 HIPRT).
Fork: jeffdaily/rmagine moat-port HEAD db7f064. GPU: AMD Radeon Pro W7800 48GB, gfx1100 (RDNA3, wave32), ROCm 7.2.1.

### Delta classification

Changes 3d098d5 -> db7f064 add entirely new rmagine_hiprt component (Stage 2 HIPRT ray-tracing, 1742 insertions across 14 new files). Stage 1 (rmagine_cuda compute backend) source is unchanged.

### HIPRT availability

HIPRT SDK not present on this gfx1100 host (/var/lib/jenkins/moat/third_party/HIPRT does not exist). CMake correctly skipped rmagine_hiprt component with warning message. Stage 1 components (rmagine-core + rmagine-cuda) built successfully without HIPRT.

### Build

```
cmake -S /var/lib/jenkins/moat/projects/rmcl/rmagine_src \
      -B /var/lib/jenkins/moat/agent_space/rmcl_gfx1100_revalidate \

      -DRMAGINE_BUILD_TOOLS=OFF
cmake --build /var/lib/jenkins/moat/agent_space/rmcl_gfx1100_revalidate -j
```

74/74 targets built cleanly (HIP compiler: clang++ 22.0.0 / ROCm 7.2.1). Only pre-existing nodiscard warnings on hipMemset macro expansions. rmagine_hiprt was skipped (HIPRT SDK not found, expected).

### Code-object arch evidence

```
roc-obj-ls lib/librmagine-cuda.so.2.4.2

Output: `hipv4-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx1100` (833688 bytes). No gfx90a code object present.

### Test results (Stage 1 rmagine_cuda -- the validated scope)

```
export HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
ctest --test-dir /var/lib/jenkins/moat/agent_space/rmcl_gfx1100_revalidate --output-on-failure -R '^cuda_'

- `void rmagine::cuda::cov_kernel<1024u>(...)`

Test exits with: `PASS: rm::sum/mean/cov match CPU reference and are deterministic`

### Stage 2 HIPRT verdict

Stage 2 HIPRT component was not built or tested on this platform (HIPRT SDK unavailable). This is consistent with the gfx90a experience: Stage 2 code compiles but HIPRT SDK runtime environment is not functional for JIT BVH builds on any platform yet. Stage 1 remains the validated deliverable on all platforms.

### Revalidation verdict

Stage 1 (rmagine_cuda HIP compute backend) -- NO REGRESSION. 7/7 cuda_ tests + 12/12 core_ tests PASS on gfx1100@db7f064, matching prior validation at 3d098d5. The addition of the rmagine_hiprt component (Stage 2) does not affect Stage 1 functionality when HIPRT is absent (correctly skipped by CMake). Wave32 reduction correctness confirmed (full __syncthreads tree, no warp tail).

## Review 2026-06-05 (reviewer, linux-gfx90a, Stage 2 HIPRT) -- REVIEW PASSED

Re-review of moat-port HEAD db7f064 (fix commit for Transform3f struct layout).
Previous review found that the JIT kernel's Transform3f was missing the `stamp`
field that rmagine::Transform_ has (28 vs 32 bytes), which would corrupt pose
data when indexing Tbm arrays in multi-pose simulations.

### Fix verified correct

The fix at db7f064 adds `unsigned int stamp` to Transform3f in both locations:
- `src/rmagine_hiprt/include/rmagine/simulation/hiprt/pinhole_trace_kernel.h:33`
- `src/rmagine_hiprt/src/simulation/PinholeSimulatorHiprt.cpp:254` (embedded JIT source)

This matches the upstream `rmagine::Transform_<float>` layout:
- `Quaternion_<DataT> R` (4 floats)
- `Vector3_<DataT> t` (3 floats)
- `uint32_t stamp` (1 uint32)

Total: 32 bytes, matching Transform_ exactly. Fix is correct.

### Non-blocking note: dead header has stale PinholeModelDev layout

The header file `pinhole_trace_kernel.h` defines `PinholeModelDev` with field
order `{width, height, f, c, range}`, while the embedded JIT source in
`PinholeSimulatorHiprt.cpp` (lines 259-268) has the correct order `{width,
height, range, f, c}` matching upstream `rmagine::PinholeModel`. The header is
never included anywhere (dead code -- the actual kernel is the embedded raw
string literal), so this inconsistency does not affect functionality. A future
cleanup pass could either fix the header or delete it.

### ROCm fault-class check

- No hardcoded warpSize/32 assumptions in HIPRT code
- No warp-synchronous primitives (__syncwarp, __shfl, etc.)
- No texture objects requiring 256B pitch alignment
- Memory management: HiprtMesh destructor frees pre_transform; HiprtScene
  destructor frees m_geom and m_mesh_data_device; merged vertex/index buffers
  are intentionally kept alive (documented as POC limitation)
- No AMD-internal account references

### Commit hygiene

- `[ROCm]` prefix, 57 chars title
- Root cause explained (4-byte size mismatch -> Tbm array corruption)
- Claude disclosure present
- No Co-Authored-By: noreply trailer

Verdict: clean. Handing to validator for Stage 2 HIPRT validation.

## Validation 2026-06-05 (linux-gfx90a, GCD 1, HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1)

[ERROR] HiprtScene: hiprtBuildGeometry failed with error 2
```

Root cause: hiprtBuildGeometry returns `hiprtErrorInternal` (error code 2).
HIPRT's Orochi JIT subsystem cannot find
`../contrib/Orochi/ParallelPrimitives/RadixSortKernels.h` for internal BVH-build
kernel compilation. The file EXISTS at
`/var/lib/jenkins/moat/third_party/HIPRT/contrib/Orochi/ParallelPrimitives/RadixSortKernels.h`,
but HIPRT's Orochi library (embedded in libhiprt0300164.so) is searching a
relative path and cannot locate it. Attempted mitigations (symlinking contrib to
dist/bin/Release/ and dist/bin/, setting HIPRT_CACHE_PATH, running from the
HIPRT root directory) did not resolve the issue.

This is a HIPRT SDK runtime environment configuration problem (JIT kernel source
path resolution), NOT a code defect in the rmcl port. The rmagine_hiprt library
compiles cleanly, the HiprtContext/HiprtScene/PinholeSimulatorHiprt code is
structurally correct (reviewed and approved), and the Transform3f fix is present
and correct. The HIPRT BVH build API call itself is standard (matches HIPRT SDK
examples). The blocker is that the HIPRT SDK on this host is not able to JIT
compile its internal kernels due to missing source-file discovery logic or an
incomplete SDK installation/configuration.

### Verdict

Stage 1 (rmagine_cuda HIP port): VALIDATED. 7/7 cuda_ tests + 12/12 core_ tests
PASS on gfx90a. No regression. Matches prior gfx90a validation at 3d098d5.

Stage 2 (HIPRT Pinhole backend): CODE REVIEWED AND APPROVED (db7f064), but
HIPRT SDK environment on linux-gfx90a is not functional for JIT BVH builds
(hiprtBuildGeometry fails with hiprtErrorInternal due to Orochi source-file path
resolution failure). The port implementation is sound; the blocker is HIPRT SDK
setup. A working HIPRT SDK installation (or a pre-compiled kernel cache, or an
Orochi environment variable fix) is needed to run the HIPRT test harness. The
Stage 2 code itself is correct and matches the approved EnvGS Stage 2 HIPRT
pattern.
