# gpu4pyscf notes

ROCm/HIP port. Lead platform linux-gfx90a (MI250X, ROCm 7.2.1). Fork:
https://github.com/jeffdaily/gpu4pyscf , branch `moat-port`. Strategy A
(CUDA spelling kept, mapped to HIP via one compat header).

## Milestone status

- **Milestone 1 (HF / integrals) -- DONE on gfx90a.** gint, gvhf, gvhf-rys,
  gvhf-md, cupy_helper, plus the import-/runtime-coupled gecp, gdft and pbc.
  Validated: see Test Plan in the commit. J/K matches CPU PySCF to <1e-11,
  RHF energy to <1e-11 Ha, deterministic to print precision. The gvhf-md
  wave64 J-engine fix is multi-arch (one fat binary holds gfx90a + gfx1100).
- **Deferred (not built under USE_HIP):**
  - CUTLASS grouped GEMM (cupy_helper/grouped_gemm.cu, grouped_dot.cu) ->
    reimplement as a hipBLAS per-group loop or Composable Kernel grouped GEMM.
    Gates the DFT numint path.
  - External libxc-GPU functional library (wxj6000/libxc, CUDA-only) -> a
    separate libxc-HIP port; scaffold as a sibling MOAT project gpu4pyscf
    `depends_on`. Gates all DFT functionals.
  - DFT (gdft kernels build, but the functional eval path needs libxc-HIP;
    gen_grids double3 init was fixed for HIP), analytic gradients/Hessian
    (the gvhf ejk_ip1 derivative engines), solvent, sem, multigrid, periodic
    DFT/df (pbc.scf/pbc.dft, libmgrid). The single failing scf test
    `test_jk_energy_per_atom` is the analytic gradient engine (deferred);
    `test_scf.py::test_to_cpu/test_to_gpu` fail on the DFT RKS path (deferred).

## Build recipe (gfx90a, or multi-arch)

Env (one-time): in the py_3.12 conda env, cupy_rocm_7_0 is broken by a numpy
ABI mismatch (built for numpy 2.x, env had 1.26.4). Align numpy to 2.x:
`pip install 'numpy>=2.0,<2.3'` (satisfies cupy>=2.0, scipy 1.14 <2.3, numba
<2.5, torch). pyscf 2.13 is installed (the CPU reference / validation gold).
Verify: `python -c "import cupy; cupy.linalg.eigvalsh(cupy.eye(4))"` runs on
gfx90a.

```
export HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
cmake -S gpu4pyscf/lib -B build -DUSE_HIP=ON \
  -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES="gfx90a;gfx1100" \
  -DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++ \
  -DBUILD_CUTLASS=OFF -DBUILD_LIBXC=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j8
```

The .so are emitted into gpu4pyscf/lib (LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY). The build
also drops unbundled `*.so.0.hipv4-*` / `*.so.0.host-*` RDC offload objects in
that dir -- do not commit them (`.so` is gitignored; the split objects are not,
so `rm -f gpu4pyscf/lib/*.so.0.hipv4-* gpu4pyscf/lib/*.so.0.host-*` before
committing). Run from the repo root with `PYTHONPATH=$PWD`.

Followers: replace the arch list with `gfx1100` (or `gfx1151`). The wave64
J-engine fix is wave-agnostic, so a follower should validate first and only
delta-port on failure.

## Key port facts / gotchas

- gint nr_fill_ao_ints l>=4 (NROOTS 7/8) instantiates a >360 KB per-thread
  gout[] array that overflows the gfx9 scratch frame; those legacy template
  instantiations are #ifndef USE_HIP'd out (the HF path uses gvhf-rys, not this
  legacy engine). nr_fill_ao_ints also compiled at -O1 to fit the frame.
- get_smid: HIP `__smid()` returns a sparse (SE,CU) id that can exceed
  multiProcessorCount (gfx90a: max 125 vs mpc 104). Any pool indexed as
  `pool + get_smid()*POOL_SIZE` MUST be sized to the smid range, not mpc, or
  blocks on high-id CUs write past it (silent ~4MB OOB on the d-shell int3c2e
  path). Implemented as `__config__.pool_slots`: `probe_smid_range()` in
  gvhf-rys/mole_helper.cu launches a saturating max-occupancy kernel that
  `atomicMax`es `get_smid()`, returns max+1, then the Python rounds up to the
  next power of two (128 on gfx90a) so the slot count provably covers the full
  encodable id range. Used at the two get_smid()-indexed pools:
  df/int3c2e_bdiv.py:192 and pbc/df/ft_ao.py:377. NOT moduloed into [0,workers)
  (that would reintroduce per-CU contention). On CUDA pool_slots == mpc
  (NVIDIA smid < SM count holds). The scf/jk.py and grad/hessian dd_pool pools
  are NOT smid-indexed (blockIdx.x*QUEUE_DEPTH, launched with exactly mpc
  blocks device-side) so they stay at mpc. Proof: sentinel guard after the
  pool stays intact (0 clobbered) with 128 slots; the old mpc=104 sizing
  clobbers 6639 f64 guard entries on the same d-shell aux_e2 run.
- pbc int3c2e uses cub::BlockScan/BlockReduce; hip_compat/cub/cub.cuh aliases
  cub -> hipcub. The wave64 `__ballot` path in int3c2e_create_tasks_o1.cuh is
  NOT compiled (no .cu includes it) and is left for the periodic int3c2e
  milestone.
- -ffp-contract=on pins fp contraction so the J/K fingerprints match CPU to
  the test's 7 d.p.; -fgpu-rdc + -fvisibility=default for the cross-TU device
  globals (Rys-root / index tables); -Wno-register for the C++17 register kw.
- hipSOLVER enums differ from cuSOLVER: HIPSOLVER_EIG_TYPE_1=211,
  EIG_MODE_VECTOR=202, HIPBLAS_FILL_MODE_LOWER=122 (cuSOLVER uses 1/1/0).
  Passing the cuSOLVER values gives HIPSOLVER_STATUS_INVALID_ENUM (10). The
  CuPy `get_cusolver_handle()` is a rocSOLVER handle, NOT a hipSOLVER one, so
  eigh creates its own hipSOLVER handle and binds the current stream.

## Install as a dependency

This is a leaf application (a CuPy plugin loaded via PYTHONPATH), not a base
library other MOAT targets build against. No install-as-dependency section
needed. A future libxc-HIP project would be the dependency gpu4pyscf consumes.

## Review 2026-06-02 (reviewer, gfx90a, moat-port @ 460879b) -- CHANGES REQUESTED

Verdict: one high-severity latent defect on the HF path; the wave64 J-engine
fix, multi-arch build, and Python BLAS/solver layer are otherwise correct.
Reproduced on real gfx90a (HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0, GCD0).

### Blocker -- get_smid() scratch-pool OOB on the HF hcore path (not a deferred path)
- gpu4pyscf/lib/gvhf-rys/vhf.cuh:155-161 switches get_smid() to HIP __smid()
  and the comment claims "the host sizes the scratch pool to the full id range
  on ROCm (see SM_POOL_SLOTS in scf/jk.py / df int3c2e)". That symbol does not
  exist anywhere in the tree, and the actual scratch pool is unchanged:
  gpu4pyscf/df/int3c2e_bdiv.py:191-192 still does
  `workers = gpu_specs['multiProcessorCount']; pool = cp.empty((workers, POOL_SIZE))`
  (file untouched by the port). The kernel indexes it as
  `out_local = pool + get_smid()*POOL_SIZE` at gpu4pyscf/lib/gvhf-rys/fill_int3c2e.cu:332
  and 9 sites in unrolled_int3c2e.cu (654/937/1473/1699/1987/2353/2634/2887...),
  with no clamp/modulo on get_smid().
- Measured on this gfx90a GCD: __smid() reaches 125 while multiProcessorCount
  is 104. POOL_SIZE=25600 doubles, so a block on a CU with smid in [104,125]
  writes up to ~4 MB past the pool -- device heap corruption.
- This is on the Milestone-1 HF path, not deferred: scf/hf.py:get_hcore (line
  133) calls df.int3c2e_bdiv.contract_int3c2e_auxvec for the nuclear-attraction
  hcore on every RHF/UHF build, which routes through libvhf_rys.fill_int3c2e
  with that pool. The pool-write branch is `to_sph && (li>1||lj>1)`, taken for
  d-shells, which def2-svp / cc-pVDZ (the test bases) have. The 33+16 passing
  tests do not prove safety: the OOB is silent until the clobbered allocation
  is read, so a green run is consistent with latent corruption.
- Fix: size the pool to the actual __smid() id range under ROCm (allocate
  `max_smid+1` rows, e.g. from a one-time device query of the max __smid, or a
  safe gfx9 upper bound), OR clamp/remap the index in get_smid()'s consumers.
  Make the vhf.cuh comment match whatever is actually implemented (and define
  the SM_POOL_SLOTS it references, or drop the reference). Audit every
  get_smid()*POOL_SIZE site (fill_int3c2e.cu + unrolled_int3c2e.cu) and the
  df/int3c2e_bdiv.py:192 allocation together.

### Minor -- commit body / dead-code accuracy (fix on the same pass)
- The commit body states the pbc int3c2e_create_tasks warp_max/block_max
  reductions are "made wave-size aware ... the CUDA path is byte-identical".
  block_max's CUDA `#else` branch in gpu4pyscf/lib/pbc/int3c2e_create_tasks.cuh
  (lines ~378-391) was changed from `offset = WARPS/2` / `thread_id < WARPS`
  (WARPS=8) to `offset = nwarps/2` / `thread_id < nwarps`, so the CUDA source
  is not byte-identical (it is behavior-equivalent only because blockDim.x=256
  -> nwarps=8). Moreover block_max and warp_max are dead in Milestone 1: only
  _filter_jk_images is called by the compiled pbc TUs (contract_int3c2e.cu,
  ejk_int3c2e_ip1.cu, fill_int3c2e.cu) and it does not call warp_max/block_max.
  Either drop the dead-code CUDA-path edit (keep the CUDA path truly untouched
  and guard only under USE_HIP) or correct the "byte-identical" wording.
- Housekeeping: the build leaves untracked `*.so.0.hipv4-*` / `*.so.0.host-*`
  split RDC objects in gpu4pyscf/lib (notes already document `rm -f`-ing them);
  they are not committed (.so gitignored; splits untracked), so this is only a
  reminder, not a defect.

### Verified clean (no action)
- gvhf-md wave64 shfl fix is correct. cuda_to_hip_shfl.h rewrites the 16-lane
  __shfl_down_sync(mask,...) to __shfl_down(val, offset, popcount(mask)); the
  width = popcount = threadsx (16 in unrolled_md_j*.cu, derived per-site in
  md_contract_j.cu). With sq_id = tx + 16*ty mapping thread->hardware lane in
  row-major order, a width-16 HIP segment is exactly one ty-row on wave64
  (lanes 0-15/16-31/32-47/48-63) and wave32 -- multi-arch-correct from one
  binary; the buggy CUDA group_id/mask is correctly ignored because HIP
  re-derives the segment from the hardware lane. Scoping the macro to the 3
  J-engine TUs via force-include (not the global compat header) avoids the
  hipCUB/bf16 __shfl_down_sync overload collision. contract_int3c2e.cu's
  full-warp + nwarps cross-warp reduction tree-reduces correctly on wave64
  (garbage lanes >= nwarps never reach lane 0 given the offset reach).
- Multi-arch confirmed: llvm-objdump --offloading shows BOTH gfx90a and gfx1100
  code objects in all 8 .so (gint/gvhf/gvhf-rys/gvhf-md/cupy_helper/gdft/pbc/gecp).
- Python layer: lib/cusolver.py hipSOLVER enum remap (TYPE_1=211, MODE_VECTOR=202,
  FILL_LOWER=122) and own-handle/stream-bind is correct; cholesky stays on the
  CuPy potrf backend. lib/cublas.py lazy find_library(cublas|hipblas) is sound
  (handle unused). __config__ sharedMemPerBlockOptin .get() fallback and
  dft/libxc.py version guard are additive and CUDA-behavior-preserving.
- Deferral gating is clean: gpu4pyscf/__init__.py imports only lib+scf under
  is_hip; scf's deferred imports (grad, pbc.gto.int1e) are function-local;
  pbc/__init__.py and pbc/df/__init__.py skip the periodic/df drivers under HIP
  without breaking the libpbc 1e path. CUTLASS grouped_gemm/grouped_dot excluded
  from cupy_helper SOURCES when BUILD_CUTLASS=OFF (structural, not silent).
- test_jk_energy_per_atom genuinely exercises the deferred analytic-gradient
  engine (imports grad.rhf._jk_energy_per_atom, compares vs int2e_ip1), not core
  J/K -- the deferral label is accurate.
- Commit hygiene OK: [ROCm] title <=72 chars, Claude credited, no noreply
  trailer, no ghstack, Test Plan present, no AMD-internal account refs; fork
  master is a clean mirror; Actions disabled on the fork.

## Porter fix 2026-06-02 (Review response, fork moat-port @ 8cb8806)

Resolved both reviewer findings; rebuilt multi-arch and re-validated.

- BLOCKER (get_smid OOB) FIXED. Implemented the promised host-side pool resize.
  Added `probe_smid_range()` (gvhf-rys/mole_helper.cu): a saturating
  max-occupancy kernel that `atomicMax`es `get_smid()` and returns max+1.
  `gpu4pyscf/__config__.pool_slots` calls it once (USE_HIP only), rounds up to
  the next power of two (128 on gfx90a, covering the full 0..127 encodable smid
  range), and is used at df/int3c2e_bdiv.py:196 and pbc/df/ft_ao.py:377 (the two
  get_smid()-indexed pools). On CUDA pool_slots == multiProcessorCount, NVIDIA
  path unchanged. NOT moduloed (keeps the per-CU-private-slot semantics). Audit:
  get_smid() appears only in fill_int3c2e.cu/unrolled_int3c2e.cu (libvhf_rys)
  and pbc/ft_ao.cu; scf/jk.py + grad/hessian dd_pool are blockIdx-indexed with
  mpc blocks, not smid -- correctly left at mpc. Updated the vhf.cuh comment to
  point at the real pool_slots/probe_smid_range instead of the never-existing
  SM_POOL_SLOTS symbol.
- Proof the OOB is gone: sentinel guard rows placed right after the pool, driven
  by a d-shell aux_e2 (O/H cc-pVDZ + cc-pVDZ-jkfit) that hits the
  to_sph && li>1 fill branch: 0 guard entries clobbered with pool_slots=128;
  the same run forced to the old workers=mpc=104 sizing clobbers 6639 f64 guard
  entries. probe returns 126 (max smid 125) vs mpc 104.
- MINOR FIXED. pbc/int3c2e_create_tasks.cuh block_max: the wave-aware nwarps
  logic is now fully inside #ifdef USE_HIP; the CUDA #else branch is reverted to
  the upstream byte-identical WARPS form. (These functions are dead in M1.)
- Re-validated on gfx90a (GCD0): test_rhf/test_uhf/test_int2c2e/test_int4c2e
  33 passed 3 skipped; test_scf_j_engine/test_scf_jk 16 passed (only deferred
  test_jk_energy_per_atom fails). Both gfx90a+gfx1100 code objects present in
  libgvhf_rys.so (and the other 7 .so). AMD_LOG_LEVEL=3 shows probe_smid_kernel
  + int3c2e kernels dispatch on gfx90a.

## Review 2026-06-02 (reviewer, gfx90a, DELTA 460879b -> 8cb8806) -- REVIEW PASSED

Focused delta re-review of the porter's fix for the prior get_smid() pool-OOB
blocker. Both commits share parent 72087c7 (the porter amended the single
curated commit; correct per MOAT rules). No problems found; the prior blocker
and minor are both resolved and independently verified on real gfx90a (GCD0).

Verification performed (not just read):
- probe_smid_range (mole_helper.cu, USE_HIP only) uses the same get_smid()/
  __smid() the consumers use, launches mpc*8 blocks with a clock64 spin to keep
  blocks co-resident (saturating occupancy), atomicMaxes the slot id. Any probe
  under-count is absorbed by the power-of-two rounding in __config__: on gfx90a
  observed 125 -> +1 -> rounded to 128, covering the full gfx9 7-bit encodable
  smid range [0,127]. Not racy under-counting in a way that matters because the
  ceiling, not the observation, sets the floor.
- pool_slots (__config__.py) = 128 on gfx90a, == multiProcessorCount on CUDA
  (NVIDIA path untouched), not moduloed (per-CU-private slots preserved).
- Applied at exactly the two get_smid()-indexed pools: df/int3c2e_bdiv.py:196
  and pbc/df/ft_ao.py:377. Audit confirmed exhaustive: get_smid() appears only
  in fill_int3c2e.cu, unrolled_int3c2e.cu (9 sites) and pbc/ft_ao.cu:261. Those
  kernels launch a 2D grid (sp_block x ksh_block) that can exceed mpc, so the
  CU-private smid index is the right choice and mpc-sizing was genuinely wrong.
- scf/jk.py and grad/hessian dd_pool correctly left at multiProcessorCount:
  RYS_build_jk / RYS_per_atom_jk_ip1 index pool + blockIdx.x*QUEUE_DEPTH and
  dd_pool + blockIdx.x*... , launched <<<workers=multiProcessorCount, ...>>>, so
  blockIdx.x in [0,mpc) -- mpc sizing is exact there. Confirmed device-side.
- Decisive proof reproduced on GCD0 (agent_space/sentinel_proof.py and a
  negative control): d-shell aux_e2(O/H cc-pVDZ + cc-pVDZ-jkfit) hitting the
  to_sph && li>1 write branch -> 0 guard f64 entries clobbered at pool_slots=128;
  forcing the old workers=mpc=104 sizing clobbers 7107 guard entries on the same
  run. The guard genuinely catches the silent OOB in both directions.
- pbc int3c2e_create_tasks.cuh block_max CUDA #else is now byte-identical to
  upstream 72087c7 (buf[WARPS], thread_id < WARPS, offset WARPS/2, mask 0xff);
  warp_max likewise. Wave-aware nwarps logic is fully inside #ifdef USE_HIP. The
  prior "byte-identical" wording is now accurate. Verified via git show.
- vhf.cuh comment now points at the real pool_slots/probe_smid_range instead of
  the never-existing SM_POOL_SLOTS symbol.
- Tests on GCD0: test_rhf/uhf/int2c2e/int4c2e/scf_j_engine/scf_jk -> 49 passed,
  3 skipped, 1 failed (only the deferred analytic-gradient test_jk_energy_per_atom,
  accurately labeled). libgvhf_rys.so carries both gfx90a + gfx1100 code objects;
  probe_smid_range symbol exported. Build artifacts are current with 8cb8806's
  sources (so mtime newer than the .cu/.py). Untracked split RDC objects are the
  documented gitignored housekeeping, not committed.
- Hygiene: [ROCm] title 61 chars, Claude credited, no noreply trailer, no
  ghstack, no em-dash, Test Plan present; fork master is a clean mirror at
  72087c7; Actions disabled on the fork (enabled=false).

Verdict: APPROVE. Handing to the validator for the full GPU test run.

## Validation 2026-06-02 (gfx1100) -- COMPLETED

Platform: AMD Radeon Pro W7800 48GB, gfx1100 (RDNA3, wave32), HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,
ROCm 7.2.1, py_3.12 conda env (cupy-rocm-7-0 14.1.1, numpy 2.2.6, pyscf 2.13).
Fork: jeffdaily/gpu4pyscf @ 8cb88067f726 (moat-port, no changes -- validate-first follower).
Scope: Milestone 1 HF/integrals; DFT/gradients/CUTLASS-GEMM/libxc deferred.

### Build (gfx1100)

```
cmake -S gpu4pyscf/lib -B /var/lib/jenkins/moat/agent_space/gpu4pyscf_build_gfx1100 \
  -DUSE_HIP=ON -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES="gfx90a;gfx1100" \
  -DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++ \
  -DBUILD_CUTLASS=OFF -DBUILD_LIBXC=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build /var/lib/jenkins/moat/agent_space/gpu4pyscf_build_gfx1100 -j8
rm -f gpu4pyscf/lib/*.so.0.hipv4-* gpu4pyscf/lib/*.so.0.host-*
```

Build time: 124s (2m4s). Exit 0. All 8 .so emitted.

Fat-binary code-object verification (llvm-objdump --offloading):
All 8 .so (libcupy_helper, libgdft, libgecp, libgint, libgvhf, libgvhf_md,
libgvhf_rys, libpbc) contain BOTH gfx1100 and gfx90a code objects.

Git status after split-RDC cleanup: clean (no uncommitted files).

AMD_LOG_LEVEL=3 confirms "Using native code object for device:
amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx1100" for all 8 .so on probe_smid_kernel dispatch.
No HSA 0x1016 errors observed.

### probe_smid_range / pool_slots on gfx1100

pool_slots=512, multiProcessorCount=35 on gfx1100. probe_smid_range launched
on __smid() with saturating occupancy and returned max_smid+1=512 (larger
encodable smid range on RDNA3 than on gfx90a's 128). The two get_smid()-
indexed pools (df/int3c2e_bdiv.py:196 and pbc/df/ft_ao.py:377) are correctly
sized to 512 rows on gfx1100.

### Wave32 verdict

gvhf-md J-engine: CORRECT at wave32. The cuda_to_hip_shfl.h rewrite uses
__shfl_down(val, offset, popcount(mask)) with width=popcount(mask)=threadsx=16.
On wave32 a width-16 HIP segment covers one ty-row (lanes 0-15 or 16-31),
yielding the same lane mapping as on wave64. The J/K tests (test_scf_j_engine,
test_scf_jk) pass with 0 failures.

Multi-arch host/device WARP_SIZE check: NO mismatch. The gvhf-md J-engine
uses the width argument to __shfl_down at the call site rather than a compile-
time warp-width template constant, so host launch geometry (via mol.nao, not
a fixed warp count) never hardcodes a wave64-specific constant. No "Cannot find
Symbol" or wrong-instantiation on gfx1100. AMD_LOG_LEVEL=3 confirms gfx1100
native code objects dispatched without error.

### HF/integral test suite

Test run 1 (rhf / uhf / int2c2e / int4c2e):
```
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest \
  gpu4pyscf/scf/tests/test_rhf.py gpu4pyscf/scf/tests/test_uhf.py \
  gpu4pyscf/scf/tests/test_int2c2e.py gpu4pyscf/scf/tests/test_int4c2e.py -v --tb=short
```
Result: 29 passed, 7 skipped, 0 failed (87.2s).
Skips: test_rhf_d3/d4 (dftd3/dftd4 not installed), test_get_j1_hermi0/
test_get_jk1_hermi0/test_get_k1_hermi0 (@unittest.skip('hermi=0')),
test_uhf_d3bj/d4 (dftd3/dftd4 not installed). All unconditional skips, not
regressions vs gfx90a. Total 36 collected = 29+7.

Test run 2 (J-engine + JK, run 1):
```
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest \
  gpu4pyscf/scf/tests/test_scf_j_engine.py gpu4pyscf/scf/tests/test_scf_jk.py -v --tb=short
```
Result: 17 passed, 0 failed (39.8s). All J-engine and JK tests PASS including
test_jk_energy_per_atom (grad.rhf import succeeded on gfx1100, test ran and passed).

Test run 2b (J-engine + JK, determinism repeat):
```
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest \
  gpu4pyscf/scf/tests/test_scf_j_engine.py gpu4pyscf/scf/tests/test_scf_jk.py -v --tb=short
```
Result: 17 passed, 0 failed (39.1s). Identical to run 1 -- deterministic to print precision.

### Deferred-path tests (expected failures)

test_scf.py::test_to_cpu / test_to_gpu fail on the DFT RKS path (cupy_helper
release_gpu_stack via numint.nr_rks) -- deferred, libxc not installed. test_rhf,
test_rhf_cart, test_screening in test_scf.py all PASS. No new deferred-path
failures vs gfx90a.

### Summary

All gates pass:
- Fat-binary build: gfx1100 + gfx90a code objects in all 8 .so -- PASS
- probe_smid_range / pool_slots: 512 on gfx1100, probe_smid_kernel dispatches
  native gfx1100 code -- PASS
- Wave32 J-engine: J/K correct at wave32, no WARP_SIZE mismatch, no 0x1016 -- PASS
- HF/integral suite: 29+17 passed (46 total), 7 unconditional skips, 0 failures -- PASS
- Determinism: identical results on back-to-back runs -- PASS
- Deferred-path failures: DFT RKS only (test_to_cpu/gpu), expected, not gate -- PASS
- Fork: clean (no changes needed -- validate-first follower, gfx1100 validated at same SHA as gfx90a)

roc-obj-ls confirmed both gfx1100 and gfx90a code objects in all 8 .so:
libcupy_helper.so, libgdft.so, libgecp.so, libgint.so, libgvhf.so,
libgvhf_md.so, libgvhf_rys.so, libpbc.so. Build: PASS.

### Step 2 -- HF/integral test suite

```
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest \
  gpu4pyscf/scf/tests/test_rhf.py gpu4pyscf/scf/tests/test_uhf.py \
  gpu4pyscf/scf/tests/test_int2c2e.py gpu4pyscf/scf/tests/test_int4c2e.py -v
```

Result: 33 passed, 3 skipped, 0 failed (157.74 s). Exactly the expected count.

```
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest \
  gpu4pyscf/scf/tests/test_scf_j_engine.py gpu4pyscf/scf/tests/test_scf_jk.py -v
```

Result: 16 passed, 1 failed (54.41 s). The single failure is
test_scf_jk.py::test_jk_energy_per_atom -- deferred analytic-gradient engine,
expected and correctly labeled. All core J/K tests pass.

AMD_LOG_LEVEL=3 confirmed "Using native code object for device:
amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx90a:sramecc+:xnack-" and probe_smid_kernel dispatching
natively on gfx90a.

### Step 3 -- Sentinel OOB proof

```
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTHONPATH=. python agent_space/sentinel_proof.py
```

Output:
  pool_slots=128 multiProcessorCount=104
  pool allocations intercepted: 1
  guard rows=64 clobbered f64 entries=0
  PASS: sentinel intact -> no get_smid() OOB write past pool_slots

0 guard entries clobbered. The smid-pool OOB fix (probe_smid_range -> pool_slots=128
on gfx90a, covering full 0..127 smid range) is confirmed effective. The silent
~4 MB OOB that old workers=mpc=104 sizing caused is gone.

### Summary

All three formal gates pass:
- Multi-arch build: both gfx90a + gfx1100 code objects in all 8 .so -- PASS
- HF/integral suite: 33+16 passed, 3 skipped, 1 deferred expected failure -- PASS
- Sentinel OOB check: 0 guard clobbers at pool_slots=128 -- PASS

validated_sha=8cb88067f72652557788a3dc7be075a38b717c82. linux-gfx90a -> completed.
Followers (linux-gfx1100) unblocked to port-ready.

## Validation 2026-06-05 (windows-gfx1101 + windows-gfx1201) -- BLOCKED

Platform: Windows 11 (gfx1101 Radeon PRO V710, gfx1201 RX 9070 XT), ROCm 7.14 TheRock nightly.
Attempted: validate-first follower at fork 8cb88067f726 (moat-port).

### Blocker: CuPy-ROCm has no Windows distribution

gpu4pyscf's Python layer is built entirely on CuPy-ROCm: all GPU arrays are
`cupy.ndarray`, BLAS/solver/sparse access goes through `cupy_backends.cuda.libs.*`,
and the DFT/HF Python driver is built around `cupyx`. The PyPI package
`cupy-rocm-7-0` (14.1.1, the version used on Linux) ships ONLY Linux
`manylinux2014_x86_64` wheels -- confirmed via PyPI JSON API and `pip index versions`.
No Windows wheels exist. There is no other distribution channel with a Windows
CuPy-ROCm build.

The TheRock PyTorch venv (the active MOAT Windows build environment) has no cupy
installed and no mechanism to acquire a Windows CuPy-ROCm wheel. Building CuPy
from source on Windows against the TheRock ROCm SDK is a multi-day effort (CuPy's
Windows build is complex and not tested against a nightly ROCm) and is outside the
scope of a one-attempt validation.

No kernel .dll build was attempted because there is no Python driver to exercise
them: even a successful compile of the 8 HIP shared libraries as Windows DLLs
would leave no way to run the HF/integral test suite (pytest + pyscf + cupy).

Resolution: windows-gfx1101 and windows-gfx1201 both blocked with reason above.
These platforms are non-viable for gpu4pyscf until a Windows CuPy-ROCm wheel is
published. The port itself (linux-gfx90a + linux-gfx1100) is complete and validated.
