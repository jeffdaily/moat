# gRASPA notes

## Build Instructions (HIP/ROCm)

```bash
cd projects/gRASPA/src
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DUSE_HIP=ON -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx90a
cmake --build . -j$(nproc)
```

The executable is at `build/src_clean/graspa`.

## Validation

Tested on gfx90a (MI250X) with CO2-MFI example:
- 288 seconds runtime
- ENERGY DRIFT: 0.00000 (all components)
- 26 CO2 molecules adsorbed

## Porting Notes

### HIP vector type operators
HIP's `HIP_vector_type` (double3/int3/etc.) has built-in operators that differ from CUDA's bare struct types:
- HIP provides member operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) and friend operators (*, /)
- HIP does NOT provide free-standing operator+ or operator- 
- Custom operators in maths.cuh are conditionally compiled with `#if !defined(__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__)` to avoid ambiguity
- Scalar operators (vector * scalar) are provided for both CUDA and HIP

### Shared memory
- HIP disallows `__shared__ bool var = false;` -- use thread-0 initialization
- Dynamic shared memory requires `extern __shared__` (same as CUDA but was missing in one kernel)
