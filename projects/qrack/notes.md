# qrack notes

GPU quantum-computer simulator. Strategy-A HIP port of the self-contained CUDA
backend (QEngineCUDA / CUDAEngine). No prior ROCm/HIP backend existed; AMD was
reachable only via the OpenCL backend. Net-new native ROCm/HIP backend.

- Upstream: https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/qrack (base 49d2efc7)
- Fork: https://github.com/jeffdaily/qrack, branch moat-port
- Lead platform: linux-gfx90a (MI250X), ROCm 7.2.1

## What changed (6 files)
- ADD include/common/cuda_to_hip.h -- the only HIP-aware file. On USE_HIP it
  includes <hip/hip_runtime.h> (+ hip_fp16.h on FPPOW<5) and aliases the ~20
  cudaXxx symbols this backend uses to hipXxx, plus `#define CUDART_CB` (empty;
  CUDA-only callback tag). On NVIDIA it is inert and includes <cuda_runtime.h>.
- cmake/CUDA.cmake -- `option(USE_HIP)`. When set: enable_language(HIP), the
  three .cu marked LANGUAGE HIP, CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES defaults to gfx90a only
  when unset, `find_package(hip)` + link `hip::host` so the HOST C++ TUs (which
  pull HIP vector types float2/float4/make_float2 via qrack_types.hpp) get the
  ROCm headers + __HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__. CUDA path unchanged (elseif branch).
- CMakeLists.txt -- gate the nvcc-only QRACK_CUDA_COMPILE_OPTS (-use_fast_math,
  -Werror all-warnings, --ptxas-options, -Xcompiler, --cudart=shared) behind the
  non-HIP path; add QRACK_HIP_COMPILE_OPTS = -O3 -ffp-contract=on -fno-math-errno
  and a `$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:HIP>` generator-expression line in each
  target_compile_options block.
- include/common/qrack_types.hpp -- route the `#include <cuda_runtime.h>` (and
  the FPPOW<5 `cuda_fp16.h`) through cuda_to_hip.h. THIS header is included by
  EVERY TU, so on HIP the host compiler must resolve HIP vector types -> hence
  hip::host on the qrack target.
- include/common/cuda_kernels.cuh, include/common/cudaengine.cuh -- include the
  compat header instead of bare cuda_fp16.h / cuda_runtime.h. CUDADeviceContext
  made non-copyable/non-movable (= delete) -- it owns two streams destroyed in
  its dtor; double hipStreamDestroy faults on ROCm (rule-of-five).

## Build recipe (gfx90a, ROCm 7.2.1)
```
cd projects/qrack/src
cmake -S . -B _build -DENABLE_CUDA=ON -DENABLE_OPENCL=OFF \
  -DUSE_HIP=ON -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx90a \
  -DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++ \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/rocm -DENABLE_TESTS=ON
cmake --build _build -j16 --target unittest
```
Config detected QBCAPPOW=7, FPPOW=5 (float -- fp16 path NOT compiled, off the
default validation path). Build clean; the three .cu compile as "Building HIP
object", links "HIP static library libqrack.a" + "HIP executable unittest".

Multi-arch check (build only): add -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES="gfx90a;gfx1100";
both `--offload-arch=gfx90a` and `--offload-arch=gfx1100` appear in the HIP
compile commands and compile cleanly -> wave-size class is source-clean (same
source builds wave64 and wave32, no per-arch guard).

## Validation (real GPU, HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3)
The unittest binary selects the GPU engine at compile time; with ENABLE_OPENCL
OFF + ENABLE_CUDA ON, `--proc-cuda --layer-qengine` binds testEngineType to
QINTERFACE_CUDA (now HIP -> QEngineCUDA) and runs circuits vs analytic/CPU
references. Init prints "CUDA device #0: AMD Instinct MI250X / MI250" on GCD3.

Every assertion that completed on the HIP engine PASSED, no mismatches against
references, across: complex/par_for helpers, exp2x2/log2x2, lossy save/load,
getmaxqpower, setconcurrency, highestproball, global_phase, cnot/anticnot/
anticy, apply_single_bit/invert, u, s/is/t/it/sh, cs/cis/ct/cit, x, xmask/
ymask/zmask, phaserootnmask, phaseparity. (8411 assertions across 32 cases in
one run; 8346 across 15 cases in another -- both interrupted only by my own
timeout SIGTERM on an in-progress slow test, never by an assertion failure.)

GOTCHA -- test wall-clock: the unittest fixture builds 20-qubit registers
(2^20 state vectors) and several tests sweep over all qubit positions
(test_apply_controlled_single_bit and the controlled/swap/fsim family are
O(n) or O(n^2) gate applications; test_approxcompare and the [mirror] tests
likewise). At width 20 on the GPU these individual tests run 5-10+ minutes
EACH, so the full --proc-cuda sweep takes hours. The width is hardcoded (and
several tests reference bit indices 18/19, so it cannot be lowered below 20
without breaking them). For a quick gate, run the fast subset and exclude the
slow sweeps with separate `~name` args (NOT comma-joined -- Catch2 ignores
`~` inside a single comma token; pass each as its own argument):
`_build/unittest --proc-cuda --layer-qengine -d yes ~test_ucmtrx ~test_ccnot ...`
Use `-d yes` for per-test progress and redirect to a FILE (a `| tail` pipe
buffers everything and loses it when a timeout SIGTERMs the run).

## Fault classes encountered
- CUDART_CB: CUDA-only host-callback calling-convention macro on the
  cudaLaunchHostFunc callback; HIP has no equivalent -> `#define CUDART_CB` to
  empty in the compat header.
- Host TUs need HIP headers: qrack_types.hpp pulls HIP/CUDA vector types
  (float2/float4/make_float2) into EVERY TU including plain .cpp built by the
  host compiler. On HIP that needs <hip/hip_runtime.h> + __HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__ in
  scope for the host compiler -> link `hip::host` on the qrack target (it
  propagates the include dirs + platform define). Without it the .cpp TUs fail
  with "cuda_runtime.h: No such file or directory".
- Rule-of-five: CUDADeviceContext (two hipStream_t, dtor destroys them) made
  non-copyable/non-movable.
- -ffp-contract: clang for HIP defaults to fast (cross-statement FMA); pinned
  -ffp-contract=on to match nvcc and avoid float drift on tolerance compares.
- Wave size: NO source change. Reductions are __syncthreads-fenced shared-mem
  trees syncing at every level (no last-warp elision); block dim from runtime
  warpSize (64 on gfx90a). Builds for gfx90a + gfx1100 from one source.
- ZERO library swaps (no cuBLAS/cuFFT/Thrust/CUB/cuRAND in this backend).

## Follower notes (gfx1100 / gfx1151)
Reuse this fork branch; validate first. No wave-size source delta anticipated
(source already compiles wave32). fp16 path (FPPOW<5, __half2) is NOT built on
the default float config and is unvalidated -- a follow-up if needed.

## Review 2026-06-04
Reviewer pass on fork moat-port @ e0c9ddfc vs base 49d2efc7 (linux-gfx90a),
via /pr-review local-branch mode. Verdict: review-passed (no must-fix).
Fault classes fact-checked against source, all clean:
- Wave size: no __shfl/__ballot/__activemask/warpSize/hardcoded-32 anywhere in
  device code (verified by grep over the 3 .cu + 2 .cuh). SUM_LOCAL reduction
  (qengine.cu:209) is a __syncthreads-fenced shared-mem tree that syncs at
  every halving level with no last-warp elision; block dim = runtime
  properties.warpSize. Wave-agnostic; same source builds gfx90a + gfx1100.
- Rule-of-five: CUDADeviceContext only ever made via std::make_shared and held
  as DeviceContextPtr (shared_ptr); no value-copy path. The four = delete
  copy/move (cudaengine.cuh:86-89) are the correct contract; nothing regresses.
- Shim coverage: every cudaXxx token used by the backend (enumerated) is
  aliased in cuda_to_hip.h. All cudaMemcpy kinds used (H2D/D2H/D2D) present;
  cudaMemsetAsync present; no plain cudaMemset/cudaEventCreate/cudaGetErrorString
  used. std::to_string(error) works on hipError_t (enum).
- CUDART_CB -> empty define; correct for the hipLaunchHostFunc callback.
- No texture/surface/neighbor reads; OOB-clamp / 256B-pitch checks N/A.
- No library swaps needed (none present).
Build system: USE_HIP option default OFF; enable_language(HIP); 3 .cu LANGUAGE
HIP; HIP target_sources matches the CUDA branch byte-for-byte (same 5 entries
incl. qhybrid.cpp/qunitmulti.cpp); nvcc-only flags gated behind non-HIP path;
HIP gets -ffp-contract=on. CUDA/NVIDIA path is byte-identical (elseif branch
unchanged). Strategy A correct; minimal footprint (6 files).
Commit hygiene: title 50 chars, [ROCm] prefix, Test Plan present, Claude named,
no Co-Authored-By-noreply, no ghstack, no em-dash/non-ASCII, no MOAT jargon.
Non-blocking note (not a defect): cmake/CUDA.cmake:42
target_compile_definitions(... __HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__=1) is redundant -- hip::host
already exports INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS "__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__=1" (identical
value, no redefinition warning). Could be dropped at PR-prep but harmless.
GPU validation run is in progress on GCD0; not gated by this review.


## VALIDATION FAILED 2026-06-04 (linux-gfx90a): nondeterministic HIP bug in UCMtrx path

The full unittest suite (`--proc-cuda --layer-qengine -d yes`, no test excluded) wedged on
`test_ucmtrx` on GCD0 for 4.4+ hours (GPU pegged at 100%) before being killed. Root-cause
investigation shows this is NOT "a huge/slow test" -- it is a correctness/synchronization defect
in the HIP `uniformlycontrolled` (UniformlyControlledSingleBit) path.

Evidence:
- CPU engine (`--proc-cpu --layer-qengine test_ucmtrx`): 1.118s, 8/8 assertions PASS.
- HIP engine, same binary/GCD, NONDETERMINISTIC across runs of the SAME isolated test:
  - run A (AMD_LOG_LEVEL=3): finished in 0.000s but FAILED 1 assertion (wrong result); only 4
    kernel launches + 28 hipMalloc, no relaunch storm.
  - run B (clean): HUNG >60s (timeout-killed).
- So: sometimes wrong-and-fast, sometimes hangs. Verbose HIP logging (which serializes API calls)
  made it complete; the clean run raced and hung. That pattern = an async hazard, not slow math.

Not the kernel or geometry (both ruled out):
- Kernel `uniformlycontrolled` (src/common/qengine.cu:493) is a clean grid-stride loop with small
  bounded inner loops; no runaway.
- Launch geometry is fine: warpSize=64 -> nrmGroupSize=64, GetPreferredConcurrency()~=65536, so
  Nthreads ~= 65536 (not zero). The grid-stride cannot spin.

Suspected location (for the porter): the host dispatch `QEngineCUDA::UniformlyControlledSingleBit`
(src/qengine/cuda.cu:1094). It does three per-call `MakeBuffer` allocations (nrmInBuffer,
uniformBuffer, powersBuffer) + `DISPATCH_WRITE`s + a `WaitCall`, then immediately
`uniformBuffer.reset()` / `qPowers.reset()`. Likely a missing synchronization between the async
buffer writes (or the buffer free) and the kernel read on the HIP/ROCm async stream -- i.e. the
kernel reads a buffer before its DISPATCH_WRITE completes, or a buffer is freed while still
in flight. Other gates (Mtrx, X, CNOT, U, S/T) pass fast on the same HIP engine, so the engine's
general dispatch is fine; this op's specific write/alloc/free ordering is the differ.

Reproduce: `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<idle gcd> ./_build/unittest --proc-cuda --layer-qengine test_ucmtrx`
-- run it several times; it is nondeterministic (wrong-fast OR hang). The fix must make it pass
RELIABLY across repeated runs.

State: linux-gfx90a review-passed -> validation-failed (back to porter). The earlier "all
completed assertions passed" porter result and the review-passed verdict both missed this because
the slow width-20 tests were never run to completion (they were SIGTERM-excluded). PROCESS LESSON:
a HIP op orders-of-magnitude slower than the CPU engine, or any SIGTERM-"slow" test, must be
root-caused -- it can be masking a race/correctness bug -- never silently excluded.

## FIXED 2026-06-04 (linux-gfx90a): hipFree inside a stream-callback deadlocks the HIP runtime

Root cause (confirmed by gdb backtrace of the live hang, not theory): QEngineCUDA dispatches
each gate asynchronously -- it launches the kernel on `device_context->queue` and registers
`_PopQueue` via `hipLaunchHostFunc` to retire the queue entry when the kernel finishes. The HIP
host-callback runs on an internal HIP runtime worker thread, and HIP (like CUDA) forbids calling
ANY runtime API from that thread. `_PopQueue -> PopQueue() -> wait_queue_items.pop_front()` drops
the QueueItem's `BufferPtr`s. For most gates those are long-lived pool/state buffers (popping
frees nothing -> callback stays API-free, which is why Mtrx/X/CNOT/U/S/T all passed on HIP). But
gates that pass PER-CALL `MakeBuffer` allocations hold the last reference in the QueueItem;
UniformlyControlledSingleBit builds 3 (uniformBuffer, powersBuffer, nrmInBuffer). Popping the item
ran the `shared_ptr` deleter `hipFree` on the callback thread -> runtime deadlock. The hang
backtrace: Thread 3 (HIP worker) stuck in `PopQueue -> ...MakeBuffer lambda... -> hipFree`
(`sched_yield` spin in libamdhip64); Thread 1 (main) blocked in the runtime from `Prob`. Verbose
AMD_LOG_LEVEL=3 serialized the API and happened to slip past the deadlock window but raced on the
data -> wrong-but-fast; a clean run hung.

Fix (fork dcb5e180, on top of e0c9ddfc; USE_HIP-guarded so NVIDIA path is byte-identical): in
`PopQueue`, move the popped item's buffers into a new `deferredFreeBuffers` member instead of
releasing them on the callback thread; drain that list (the real hipFree) from `clFinish` and the
top of `DispatchQueue`, both of which run on a user thread. New member + `DrainDeferredFreeBuffers()`
helper, all under `#if defined(USE_HIP)`. +41 lines, 2 files (src/qengine/cuda.cu,
include/qengine_cuda.hpp).

GOTCHA for any HIP port using hipLaunchHostFunc/cudaLaunchHostFunc: the callback MUST NOT call any
HIP API. A shared_ptr/RAII handle whose deleter calls hipFree/hipStreamDestroy/etc. that drops its
last ref inside the callback is the trap; defer the release to a user thread. CUDA tolerates it
more often, so it survives the NVIDIA build and only bites on ROCm.

Validation (real GPU, HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1, MI250X, ROCm 7.2.1):
- test_ucmtrx: 12/12 consecutive runs PASS 8/8 assertions, ~0.23s each (was hang/wrong).
- previously-SIGTERM-"slow" gates now complete in ~0.2s each and pass: test_ccnot, test_anticcnot,
  test_uniform_c_single (16), test_uniform_cry (14), test_uniform_crz (12), test_cuniformparityrz,
  test_uniformparityrz, test_swap, test_iswap, test_cswap, test_anticswap, test_csqrtswap,
  test_fsim, test_apply_controlled_single_bit/invert/phase + anti variants, test_timeevolve_uniform.
  (The "5-10 min per test" in the prior note was the deadlock spinning, NOT real math cost.)
- FULL --proc-cuda --layer-qengine suite: All tests passed, 9472 assertions in 205 test cases,
  46.8s total wall (was 4.4+ hours wedged on test_ucmtrx).

State: validation-failed -> porting -> ported.

## Review 2026-06-04 (deferred-free fix dcb5e180)
Reviewer pass on fork moat-port, delta e0c9ddfc..dcb5e180 (linux-gfx90a), via
/pr-review local-branch mode. Verdict: review-passed (no must-fix). The +41-line
fix (deferredFreeBuffers + DrainDeferredFreeBuffers) is correct and fully
USE_HIP-guarded.

Fact-checked against source:
- Deferred-free correctness: the only callback-thread ref-drop is in PopQueue.
  PopQueue takes a local copy `item = wait_queue_items.front()` (cuda.cu:374) so
  the subsequent pop_front() (383) does not zero the refcount; the buffers are
  then std::move'd into deferredFreeBuffers (393-396) and the real hipFree runs
  later on a user thread. Correct.
- No leak / no unbounded growth: every enqueue routes AddQueueItem ->
  DispatchQueue (qengine_cuda.hpp:553/561), and DispatchQueue drains at its top
  (cuda.cu:402-404), so each new op frees the prior op's deferrals. The tail is
  caught by clFinish (cuda.cu:319-321) and by teardown
  (~QEngineCUDA -> FreeAll -> ZeroAmplitudes -> clDump -> clFinish -> drain).
- Drain frees only completed-op buffers: a buffer reaches deferredFreeBuffers
  only after its callback fired (kernel done), so it is never in-flight when
  freed. Draining at DispatchQueue top before the empty-check is safe.
- Thread-safety: deferredFreeBuffers is touched only under queue_mutex --
  producer PopQueue holds it for the whole body (cuda.cu:359), consumer
  DrainDeferredFreeBuffers holds it for the swap (349-350). No double-lock:
  clFinish does not hold queue_mutex when it calls the drain; DispatchQueue
  drains before taking its own lock. No recursive lock.
- NVIDIA path byte-identical: all 5 hunks are inside #if defined(USE_HIP);
  the CUDA build sees no change.
Commit hygiene: subject 58 chars, [ROCm] prefix, root cause + Test Plan present,
Claude named, no Co-Authored-By-noreply, no ghstack, ASCII clean, no MOAT jargon.
Non-blocking observation (not a defect): the helper uses an `if (true) { ... }`
scope block (cuda.cu:348) to bound the lock_guard; this matches the existing
file idiom (AddQueueItem qengine_cuda.hpp:556, DispatchQueue cuda.cu:408), so it
is consistent and fine.
GPU re-validation (full suite at the new HEAD) runs next in the validator stage.

## Validation 2026-06-04 (linux-gfx90a, final GPU gate)

Platform: MI250X gfx90a, ROCm 7.2.1. Fork jeffdaily/qrack moat-port @ dcb5e180.
GCD: HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 (GCDs 0/1/3 idle; 2 busy).

Build: incremental `cmake --build _build -j16 --target unittest` (no recompile needed;
binary freshly built from the dcb5e180 commit at 20:55 UTC same day as sources at 20:54).
Config: -DUSE_HIP=ON -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx90a -DENABLE_CUDA=ON
-DENABLE_OPENCL=OFF -DENABLE_TESTS=ON

Full suite: `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 ./_build/unittest --proc-cuda --layer-qengine -d yes`
Result: All tests passed -- 9472 assertions in 205 test cases.
Wall time: ~46s.

test_ucmtrx repeat runs (deferred-free fix confirmation):
12/12 consecutive runs: All tests passed (8 assertions in 1 test case each), ~0.23s per run.
