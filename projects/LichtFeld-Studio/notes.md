# LichtFeld-Studio notes (ROCm/HIP port, lead linux-gfx90a)

## What this port covers (SCOPE -- read first)
LichtFeld-Studio is a full 3DGS workstation (GUI + Vulkan viewer + Python/MCP +
USD + nvjpeg). MOAT ports only the **libtorch-free GPU COMPUTE tranche** and
GPU-validates it; the GUI/Vulkan-interop/Python/MCP/USD/nvImageCodec layers are
explicitly DEFERRED (gated out under USE_HIP). Compute tranche:
- lfs_core / its tensor library (src/core/tensor + src/core/cuda)
- lfs_training + lfs_training_kernels (Adam, schedulers, losses, SSIM, MCMC,
  densification, pruning, bilateral grid, ppisp)
- fastlfs_backend (fastgs fwd/bwd rasterizer + fused Adam)
- gsplat_backend_lfs (vendored gsplat: projection, intersect/tile, rasterize
  fwd/bwd, SH, relocation)
- edge_compute_backend (igs+ edge rasterizer)
- support libs: lfs_geometry, lfs_diagnostics, lfs_logger, lfs_event_bridge

## Environment (gfx90a host)
- 4x MI250X GCD (gfx90a, wave64), ids 0-3. Use a FREE GCD via HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES
  (check `rocm-smi --showuse`/`--showmemuse`; GPU 3 was free at bringup).
- ROCm 7.2.1, hipcc /opt/rocm/bin/hipcc, clang++ /opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++,
  cmake+ninja from conda env py_3.12.
- Deps NOT via vcpkg (VCPKG_ROOT empty). Supplied directly:
  - glm: VENDORED 1.0.1 at /var/lib/jenkins/moat/_deps/glm-1.0.1 (passed via
    -DLFS_GLM_INCLUDE_DIR). The SYSTEM glm is 0.9.9.8, which needs __CUDACC__ to
    emit device qualifiers -- and defining __CUDACC__ breaks rocThrust (see GLM
    fix below). 1.0.1 has a native GLM_COMPILER_HIP path (keys on __HIPCC__) so
    glm:: math compiles in __device__ code under hipcc with NO macro hack.
  - GTest: conda /opt/conda/envs/py_3.12/lib/cmake/GTest.
  - libtorch (test parity oracle): the ROCm python torch (torch 2.13.0a0, hip
    7.2.53211) at /opt/conda/envs/py_3.12/.../torch/share/cmake (Torch_DIR).
  - args.hxx (Taywee, used only by argument_parser.cpp): VENDORED at
    /var/lib/jenkins/moat/_deps/lfs_args (-DLFS_ARGS_INCLUDE_DIR). No apt pkg.
  - apt-installed: libstdc++-14-dev + gcc-14 (C++23 <print> is absent from the
    system libstdc++ 13; clang picks gcc-14 automatically), nlohmann-json3-dev,
    libspdlog-dev, libopenimageio-dev (for image_io.cpp), libopenmesh-dev (for
    mesh_data.cpp). TBB from /usr.
  - OpenImageIO / OpenMesh CMake configs are built BY HAND in HipCompute.cmake
    (find_library + INTERFACE target): the apt -dev OpenImageIOConfig references
    CLI tool binaries (iconvert) the package omits, which trips find_package;
    OpenMesh ships only OpenMeshCore (the leaf CMake asks for OpenMeshCoreStatic).
- rocThrust is a drop-in: <thrust/...> resolves from /opt/rocm/include unchanged
  (no shim). Only cub/cuda*/curand/cooperative_groups/nvtx need shims.

## Build command (lead gfx90a) -- script agent_space/lfs_build.sh
```
cmake -S projects/LichtFeld-Studio/src -B build-hip -G Ninja \
  -DUSE_HIP=ON -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx90a \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++ \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang \
  -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DTorch_DIR=/opt/conda/envs/py_3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages/torch/share/cmake/Torch \
  -DLFS_GLM_INCLUDE_DIR=/var/lib/jenkins/moat/_deps/glm-1.0.1 \
  -DLFS_ARGS_INCLUDE_DIR=/var/lib/jenkins/moat/_deps/lfs_args
cmake --build build-hip -j16
```
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH must include the torch cmake dir + conda GTest + /usr (the
script sets it). Do NOT pass -DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER (it triggers a reconfigure that
drops -DUSE_HIP); HIP is enabled at project() time (LANGUAGES HIP) and CMake finds
clang at /opt/rocm. For followers: pass -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx1100/gfx1151
unchanged (no source edit). gfx90a is wave64; followers are wave32.

## How -DUSE_HIP gates the build (CMakeLists.txt + cmake/HipCompute.cmake)
USE_HIP is a plain cache BOOL (NOT option(): option() resets to its default on
the compiler-detection reconfigure and silently falls back to the NVIDIA path).
When USE_HIP, the top-level CMakeLists does `project(... LANGUAGES HIP CXX C)`,
`include(cmake/HipCompute.cmake)`, then `return()` -- the entire NVIDIA
find_package storm + GUI subdirs + main exe + monolithic tests are skipped.
HipCompute.cmake: enable HIP arch (default gfx90a only when unset), force-include
the compat header on every HIP TU, add src/hip_compat + src/core/include +
/opt/rocm/include to the include path, retag every .cu LANGUAGE HIP via a
top-scope add_library/add_executable override, stub CUDA::cudart/curand/
cuda_driver/cupti/nvToolsExt as INTERFACE targets (HIP runtime is implicit;
hiprand linked for RNG), then add_subdirectory the compute libs + cmake/hip_tests.

## Why a dedicated compute-test exe (open question #2 resolved)
The monolithic `lichtfeld_tests` target (tests/CMakeLists.txt) irreducibly links
lfs_mcp, lfs_visualizer, lfs_rendering, lfs_sequencer + nanobind/imgui/implot/
assimp/Vulkan -- the whole GUI/USD/Python graph -- and mixes ~93 compute tests
with ~85 GUI/MCP/Python/USD tests in one exe. It cannot be decoupled without
source surgery, so under USE_HIP we build a NEW `lfs_compute_tests` exe (build-file
addition only) linking just the compute libs + GTest + ROCm libtorch + the compute
test sources. The upstream `lichtfeld_tests`/`lichtfeld_benchmarks` + main app +
GUI find_package storm are gated behind `if(NOT USE_HIP)`.

## Library-coupling caveat (not in original plan)
lfs_core PRIVATE-links OpenImageIO + lfs_geometry; lfs_training links lfs_io
(FFMPEG/WebP/archive/nvimgcodec) + lfs_python_utils. So the compute libs are NOT
cleanly isolated at link time. Under USE_HIP these GUI/io deps are severed (see
the per-CMakeLists USE_HIP gating) and the few host .cpp that use OpenImageIO /
io are excluded or stubbed for the compute build.

## Fault classes hit + fixes (all guarded #if USE_HIP || __HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__ unless noted)

The compat header is src/core/include/core/cuda/cuda_to_hip.h (the ONLY file that
knows HIP); shim headers in src/hip_compat/ resolve the toolkit angle-includes.

1. WAVE SIZE (the only correctness-bearing source edits; arch-unified, correct on
   wave64 AND wave32). A kWarpSize abstraction (64 on CDNA __GFX9__, else 32) +
   64-bit shuffle mask:
   - src/core/tensor/internal/warp_reduce.cuh AND src/training/include/lfs/core/
     warp_reduce.cuh (a vendored duplicate): warp_reduce_{sum,max,min,prod} offset
     16->kWarpSize/2, mask 0xffffffff->64-bit; block_reduce_* lane/warp_id %/ 32
     -> kWarpSize. These recombine per-warp partials via shared memory, so the
     native-64 fold is correct (PORTING_GUIDE AutoDock atomicAdd-combine class).
   - tensor_warp_reduce.cu warp_medium_segment_reduce_* (one segment per warp +
     stride-32 gather): warp_id/lane/warps_per_block AND the gather strides
     (+= 32, base += 32) all -> kWarpSize, so a 64-lane warp owns one segment and
     gathers stride-64. Host WARPS_PER_BLOCK left at /32 (a grid-sizing floor; the
     kernel is a grid-stride loop so any value is correct).
   - tensor_broadcast_ops.cuh broadcast_channel3d_kernel (one pixel per warp +
     stride-32 channel gather): warp_id/lane_id/num_warps + ch_base += 32 ->
     kWarpSize.
   - tensor_debug.cu validate_tensor_kernel (test_nan_inf_gpu_check backend) and
     mcmc_kernels.cu histogram (one index per warp): WARP_SIZE 32 -> kWarpSize,
     __shfl_down_sync mask -> 64-bit.
   - ssim.cu warp_id/lane_id/32 left AS-IS: these are a tid-based 2D loop
     decomposition for shared-tile loading (no shfl/ballot/syncwarp), recombined
     by block.sync(); provably correct on wave64. tensor_strided_ops.cu:570
     WARP_SIZE=32 is a host coalescing HEURISTIC (iteration-order choice), not lane
     math; left as-is.
2. cg::reduce: ROCm CG has none. gsplat Utils.cuh warpSum/warpMax (GSPLAT_WARP_SUM/
   MAX macro -> butterfly warp.shfl_xor all-reduce on HIP, cg::reduce on CUDA) and
   RasterizeToPixelsFromWorld3DGSBwd warp_bin_final (int-max butterfly). The
   thread_block_tile<32> is wave-agnostic (gsplat MOAT-port lesson). ProjectionUT
   uses "optional" only in comments -- NO cuda::std, so NO libhipcxx needed.
3. GLM in device code: vendored GLM 1.0.1 (native HIP path), so the compat header
   deliberately does NOT define __CUDACC__/CUDA_VERSION/GLM_FORCE_CUDA (defining
   __CUDACC__ makes rocThrust take its broken CUDA-system path:
   <cub/detail/detect_cuda_runtime.cuh> not found).
4. float3 operator ambiguity: fastgs + edge_compute helper_math.h -- HIP's
   HIP_vector_type provides all float2/3/4 arithmetic operators, so the hand-rolled
   operator overloads (negate/+/-/*//, ~lines 218-854) AND the host scalar int
   min/max are skipped on HIP (using std::min/std::max brought in for the vector
   helpers' unqualified calls). The named helpers (dot/cross/clamp/lerp/...) and
   make_*(1-arg) stay -- HIP lacks those. Host fminf/fmaxf/rsqrtf kept (guarded on
   the device-compile macro, not USE_HIP, so the HIP HOST pass still gets them).
5. __ballot_sync 64-bit mask: fastgs + edge kernels_forward.cuh
   `__ballot_sync(0xffffffffu, active) == 0` -> LFS_BALLOT_MASK (64-bit on HIP).
   The "any lane active" early-exit is wave-agnostic.
6. CUB: cub/* shim -> hipcub + `namespace cub = hipcub`. IntersectTile
   DeviceRadixSort::SortPairs(begin_bit=0) + DeviceScan::InclusiveSum work on
   hipCUB (the nonzero-begin_bit hipCUB bug does NOT apply -- begin_bit=0).
   hipCUB's DeviceSegmentedReduce::Reduce unifies the begin/end offset iterators
   into ONE OffsetIteratorT (tensor_ops.cu: use a single shared lambda).
7. thrust::cuda -> thrust::hip alias (rocThrust execution policy namespace) in the
   5 thrust-using .cu (tensor_ops/masking/warp_reduce, selection_ops, mcmc_kernels,
   + tensor_generic_ops.cuh). par/par_nosync resolve unchanged.
8. __CUDA_ARCH__ defined only in the HIP DEVICE pass (compat header, guarded by
   __HIP_DEVICE_COMPILE__) so the device-intrinsic guards (powf/fmodf/__ldcs) take
   the device branch; host pass + rocThrust unaffected. The `#ifdef __CUDACC__`
   guards gating device template code (tensor_ops.hpp, tensor_broadcast_ops.cuh,
   tensor_functors.hpp, logger.hpp) changed to `|| defined(__HIPCC__)`.
9. CUdeviceptr is integer on CUDA, void* on HIP (memory_arena.cu VMM): pointer
   arithmetic on the virtual base goes through LFS_DPTR_OFF (byte pointer on HIP).
   CUDA driver VMM symbols (cuMemCreate/Map/SetAccess/..., CUmem*) aliased to hip*.
10. packed128.cuh __ldcs/__stcs/__stcg on int4 -> plain load/store on HIP (HIP has
    these only for a few scalar types; the cache hint is perf-only). __nv_bfloat16
    -> __hip_bfloat16 alias.
11. __half conversion ambiguity (tensor.cpp): HIP __half has operator=(float) AND
    (double), so int/uint8 -> __half is ambiguous. Extracted the per-element CPU
    convert into a template helper (convert_one<F,T>) so `if constexpr` discards
    dead branches; __half routes through float. (Portable, not USE_HIP-guarded.)
12. cudaFuncSetAttribute(kernel,...) -> (const void*)kernel cast (gsplat 2 sites;
    portable). NVTX nvtxRangePush/Pop -> no-ops on HIP.
13. libtorch (ROCm) test oracle: c10/cuda headers reference stream-capture/graph/
    IPC cuda* symbols literally (torch hipifies them only at CUDAExtension build
    time); aliased in the compat header's "libtorch interop" block + the test exe
    defines C10_CUDA_NO_CMAKE_CONFIGURE_FILE and USE_ROCM (torch's documented AMD
    escape hatch for the unported cuda_cmake_macros.h).

## DEFERRED (gated out under USE_HIP, NOT failures)
- GUI / Vulkan viewer (src/visualizer), CUDA<->Vulkan external-memory interop
  (src/rendering/cuda_vulkan_interop.*), Python/nanobind (src/python,
  lfs_python_utils), MCP server (src/mcp), USD/assimp import, nvImageCodec/nvjpeg
  GPU image decode (external/nvImageCodec, lfs_io's nvcodec path), FFmpeg video
  (lfs_video). The top-level CMake never configures these under USE_HIP.
- lfs_io (PLY/SOG/SPZ/USD/colmap loaders + FFmpeg/WebP/archive/nvjpeg): NOT built;
  lfs_training's link to it is severed under USE_HIP and the io-coupled training
  orchestration (trainer.cpp, training_setup.cpp, checkpoint.cpp, metrics.cpp,
  strategies/mrnf.cpp, improved_gs_plus.cpp, strategy_factory.cpp,
  control/command_api.cpp -> all pull dataset.hpp/io) is dropped from the compute
  lfs_training. The compute gtests drive kernels/optimizer/rasterizers directly.
- src/core/cuda/exportable_storage.cpp (CUDA-IPC cross-process memory export):
  excluded (HIP has no handle-type-supported device attribute); not used by the
  compute kernels.
- Headless training smoke (--headless on a COLMAP scene): NOT run -- the trainer/
  dataloader/io tranche is deferred, so the headless entrypoint is not built in
  the compute configuration. The compute gtest set (incl. rasterizer fwd/bwd +
  Adam + losses against the libtorch oracle) is the GPU correctness gate here.

## VALIDATION (gfx90a / MI250X, ROCm 7.2.1, HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0, serial)
Fork tip validated: 580e0012 (moat-port).
Built: all 9 compute libs (lfs_core, lfs_core_cuda, lfs_tensor_kernels,
lfs_geometry, lfs_diagnostics, lfs_training, gsplat_backend_lfs, fastlfs_backend,
edge_compute_backend) + lfs_compute_tests, clean.

lfs_compute_tests (876 GPU-compute gtests, single-process => serial; ROCm
libtorch parity oracle): **874 passed, 2 failed**, BIT-IDENTICAL across two runs
(determinism confirmed; 12.6 s). The wave64-critical subset -- 307 tests covering
tensor reductions (the offset-16/kWarpSize fix), warp/block reductions,
tensor-vs-torch + torch-comparison parity, gsplat + fastgs rasterizers (cg::reduce
shim + ballot), SSIM, fused L1+SSIM, losses, MCMC tensor/memory ops, sort, matrix,
random/curand -- ALL pass (only the MCMC quantization-design test below appears in
that filter).

The 2 failures are DETERMINISTIC and NOT wave64 / port-correctness defects (they
fail identically on CUDA by construction):
- MCMCTest.RemoveGaussiansSoftDeletesRows: AdamParamState.exp_avg is a uint8
  QUANTIZED moment buffer with QUANTIZED_MOMENT_ZERO_POINT=128 (adam_optimizer:32).
  Soft-delete zeroes the per-primitive SCALE (dequant -> 0), not the raw quant
  buffer. The test reads the RAW uint8 buffer (.to_vector() -> 128 = zero-point =
  dequantized 0.0) and asserts == 0.0f, which is incompatible with the quantized
  representation (128, not 0, is "zero"). Pure integer quantization, identical on
  any GPU. A test/impl design mismatch, not HIP.
- ImageKernelsTest.FusedCannyUInt8MatchesNormalizedFloatInput: compares the Canny
  edge output of a float input (CPU-normalized byte*(1/255)) vs a uint8 input
  (GPU-normalized byte*(1.0f/255.0f)) at a tight 1e-5 tolerance. The two
  normalizations differ by ~1 ULP; the Canny non-max-suppression hysteresis
  (roundf(grad/mag) -> integer neighbor direction) is discontinuous, so one ULP
  flips one pixel's edge direction -> a 0.409 single-pixel diff. The kernel is
  bit-deterministic and wave-agnostic (shared-memory stencil, no shfl/ballot);
  this is a cross-input FP-decision-boundary sensitivity in the TEST (gsplat
  fault-13 / gfx1151-radius class), not a kernel bug.

## Review 2026-05-31 (reviewer, linux-gfx90a, fork 580e0012 moat-port)
VERDICT: review-passed (proceed to GPU validation). Strategy A executed correctly; NVIDIA path provably isolated; all six wave-size fix sites + the gsplat cg::reduce butterfly verified wave64-correct by reading each site; commit hygiene clean. No changes-requested-level defects.

Verification performed (every claim read at file:line, not taken on faith):
- NVIDIA isolation HOLDS: CMakeLists.txt wraps the vcpkg/GUI-preflight/CUDA-project lines in `if(NOT USE_HIP)` and, under USE_HIP, does `project(... LANGUAGES HIP CXX C)` + include(HipCompute.cmake) + return() BEFORE `project(... LANGUAGES CUDA CXX C)` and the find_package storm. USE_HIP is a plain cache BOOL (not option()), correct per the reconfigure-reset gotcha. CUDA build never sees USE_HIP; the only edits to CUDA-reachable lines are pure `if(NOT USE_HIP)` wrapping (behavior identical). No .cu renamed (set_source_files_properties LANGUAGE HIP via the top-scope add_library/add_executable override). No host .cpp touched needlessly; all changes confined to src/, cmake/, top CMakeLists; no .github/workflow/yml edits.
- wave64 reductions all recombine per-warp partials through shared memory keyed on warp_id (AutoDock class), so native-64 fold is correct: warp_reduce.cuh x2 (offset=LFS_WARP_REDUCE_SIZE/2, 64-bit mask; block_reduce shared[32] is a safe upper bound -- 16 warps on wave64, 32 on wave32), tensor_warp_reduce.cu (warp_id/lane/warps_per_block + gather strides -> LFS_WARP_REDUCE_SIZE; host WARPS_PER_BLOCK=BLOCK_SIZE/32 is a launch floor only -- kernel is a true grid-stride loop `seg_idx += gridDim.x*warps_per_block`, device recomputes warps_per_block=blockDim.x/LFS_WARP_REDUCE_SIZE), tensor_broadcast_ops.cuh (one pixel/warp, channel gather stride -> LFS_BCAST_WARP_SIZE, per-lane writes guarded ch<C, no cross-lane reduce), tensor_debug.cu validate_tensor_kernel (shared sized BLOCK_SIZE/WARP_SIZE, final warp folds num_warps-guarded lanes; 64-bit __shfl_down mask), mcmc_kernels.cu histogram (one index/warp, lane0 writes, 64-bit mask).
- gsplat cg::reduce shim: butterfly warp.shfl_xor over warp.size() on a cg::thread_block_tile<32> is an all-reduce that is wave-agnostic (32-lane tile stays in-tile on a 64-lane wavefront); identical result to cg::reduce in every lane. Verified Utils.cuh warpSum/warpMax (GSPLAT_WARP_SUM/MAX) + RasterizeToPixelsFromWorld3DGSBwd warp_bin_final int-max. cudaFuncSetAttribute const void* cast is portable.
- ssim.cu left as /32 CONFIRMED correct: warp_id/lane_id/num_warps/col+=32 are a tid-based 2D shared-tile load decomposition (each cell written once, read after block.sync()); NO __shfl/__ballot/__syncwarp anywhere in those blocks -> provably wave64-safe, not lane math. Not in the diff (unchanged file), built+tested.
- GLM: compat header deliberately does NOT define __CUDACC__/CUDA_VERSION/GLM_FORCE_CUDA (would make rocThrust take its broken CUDA path); GLM 1.0.1 native HIP path keys on __HIPCC__. CONFIRMED no preprocessor CUDA_VERSION is consumed anywhere in the compute tree (only stale comments in Common.h/Cameras.cuh; cuda_version.hpp's MIN_CUDA_VERSION is an unrelated plain constant).
- The 2 failures are genuinely NOT wave64/port defects (verified against test source + impl): MCMCTest.RemoveGaussiansSoftDeletesRows reads the RAW uint8 exp_avg via .to_vector() (test_mcmc.cpp:88-98) and asserts ==0.0f, but QUANTIZED_MOMENT_ZERO_POINT=128 (adam_optimizer.cpp:32) fills that buffer with the zero-point and soft-delete zeroes the fp32 scale, not the raw quant buffer -- pure integer quantization, identical on any GPU. FusedCannyUInt8MatchesNormalizedFloatInput (test_image_kernels.cpp) compares CPU byte*(1/255) vs GPU-normalized uint8 Canny output at 1e-5 across the roundf NMS hysteresis discontinuity; kernel is a wave-agnostic shared-memory stencil (no shfl/ballot), so this is a cross-input FP-decision-boundary sensitivity in the test.
- Fault classes clear: NO textures/surfaces in the built compute tree (the cudaSurfaceObject_t path is the deferred Vulkan-interop layer) -> 256B-pitch + texture rule-of-five N/A. IntersectTile SortPairs passes begin_bit=0 (end_bit=32+tile_n_bits+cam_n_bits), so the nonzero-begin_bit hipCUB bug does not apply, and the DoubleBuffer selector readback (`if d_keys.selector==0` copy) is backend-agnostic+correct. << 32 / >> 32 in IntersectTile/kernels_backward are 64-bit key packing, not lane math. helper_math.h operator/min-max guards are keyed on the device-compile macro (__CUDA_ARCH__/__HIP_DEVICE_COMPILE__), the correct gate so the HIP HOST pass still gets the scalar fallbacks. packed128 __ldcs/__stcs/__stcg -> plain int4 load/store (perf-only hint). memory_arena CUdeviceptr byte-pointer arithmetic correct (d_ptr is hipDeviceptr_t=void* on HIP). thrust::cuda->thrust::hip alias guarded in all 5 sites; CUB cub=hipcub shim. tensor.cpp convert_one<F,T> template refactor is behavior-preserving on CUDA (routes __half via float; portable).
- Commit hygiene: title 68 chars, [ROCm] prefix; body Claude-disclosed, Test Plan present, no Co-Authored-By/noreply/ghstack/Signed-off; ASCII-only; no AMD-internal account refs; single curated commit on moat-port; arch defaulted (gfx90a only when unset), not literal.

Minor (non-blocking, optional cleanup; do NOT churn HEAD solely for these):
- src/hip_compat/cuda.h comment says "The compat header already defines CUDA_VERSION" but cuda_to_hip.h (lines 216-224) deliberately does NOT define CUDA_VERSION. Functionally harmless (GLM 1.0.1 keys on __HIPCC__; no code consumes preprocessor CUDA_VERSION on the HIP path) -- the shim correctly just routes the include. Comment is inaccurate; fix the wording if/when the file is next touched.
- cmake/hip_tests/CMakeLists.txt omits several tests the plan listed as representative (test_fastgs_kernels, test_fastgs_fuzz, test_gut_*, test_rotated_sh_correctness, test_sh_swizzle_layout, test_mrnf_strategy, test_mcmc_relocate_optimizer_state_bug, and the CPU regression set test_cpu_*). The build emits a WARNING for any missing file and documents io/GUI-coupled omissions; the 876-test set is the validator's reproducible gate. Not a defect, but the validator should confirm the 876 count and that no wave64-relevant rasterizer/SH test was silently dropped (vs deliberately io-coupled).

Safe to proceed to GPU validation. The missing-GPU-run-at-review-time is expected; the validator runs lfs_compute_tests serially on gfx90a next.

## Validation 2026-05-31 (validator, linux-gfx90a, gfx90a / MI250X, ROCm 7.2.1)

Arch: gfx90a (MI250X, wave64). GCD: HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 (GPU 0, 0% use at run time).
Fork validated at: e24593f4ea6b1aff0f45b1dd98cab2209b0fd17e (moat-port, amended from 580e0012 to add 3 dropped test files).

### Test-coverage check (reviewer-flagged omissions)

Reviewer flagged these as omitted from cmake/hip_tests/CMakeLists.txt:
- test_gut_* -- DO NOT EXIST in tests/. Non-issue.
- test_fastgs_kernels.cpp -- includes io/formats/ply.hpp (io tranche). DELIBERATE io-coupled omission.
- test_fastgs_fuzz.cpp -- includes io/formats/ply.hpp. DELIBERATE io-coupled omission.
- test_rotated_sh_correctness.cpp -- includes io/exporter.hpp + io/formats/ply.hpp. DELIBERATE io-coupled omission.
- test_sh_swizzle_layout.cpp -- includes io/formats/ply.hpp (real PLY fixture required). DELIBERATE io-coupled omission.
- test_mrnf_strategy.cpp -- includes training/strategies/mrnf.hpp -> mrnf.cpp -> io/pipelined_image_loader.hpp + training/dataset.hpp; mrnf.cpp is excluded from lfs_training under USE_HIP because it pulls the deferred io tranche. DELIBERATE io-coupled omission (would fail to link).
- test_mcmc_relocate_optimizer_state_bug.cpp -- only includes optimizer/adam_optimizer.hpp + core. NO io dependency. SILENTLY DROPPED. Added.
- test_cpu_dtype_conversions.cpp -- only includes core/tensor.hpp. NO io dependency. SILENTLY DROPPED. Added.
- test_cpu_large_tensor_bugs.cpp -- only includes core/tensor.hpp. NO io dependency. SILENTLY DROPPED. Added.

The 3 silently dropped tests were added to cmake/hip_tests/CMakeLists.txt and the fork commit amended + force-with-lease pushed to jeffdaily/LichtFeld-Studio moat-port.

### Build (incremental, --target lfs_compute_tests)

```
export HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
export ROCM_PATH=/opt/rocm HIP_PLATFORM=amd
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<torch-cmake>:<gtest-cmake>:/opt/conda/envs/py_3.12:/usr"
cmake --build /var/lib/jenkins/moat/projects/LichtFeld-Studio/src/build-hip --target lfs_compute_tests -j16
```
Result: PASS (3 new .cpp compiled, lfs_compute_tests relinked, 0 errors). Near-no-op for the 9 compute libs (already built).

### GPU test run (serial, HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0)

```
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ./build-hip/cmake/hip_tests/lfs_compute_tests
```
Run 1: 914 tests from 48 suites ran (~13.1 s). 911 passed, 3 failed.
Run 2: 914 tests from 48 suites ran (~12.9 s). 911 passed, 3 failed.
BIT-IDENTICAL across both runs (determinism confirmed).

### Failures (3 total, all documented non-bugs identical on CUDA)

1. MCMCTest.RemoveGaussiansSoftDeletesRows -- DOCUMENTED (pre-existing). Reads raw uint8 quant exp_avg via ptr<float>(); zero-point=128 means "0.0" is 0x80808080 (NaN as float). Identical on any GPU.
2. ImageKernelsTest.FusedCannyUInt8MatchesNormalizedFloatInput -- DOCUMENTED (pre-existing). 1-ULP cross-input FP boundary in Canny NMS hysteresis; wave-agnostic stencil kernel.
3. MCMCRelocateOptimizerStateTest.ResetBothSourceAndDestinationRows -- NEWLY OBSERVED (added test). Same class as #1: EXPECT_GT(total_momentum, 0.0f) fails because raw uint8 quant bytes read as float give NaN (zero-point=128, 0x80808080 per float). The actual GPU kernel zero_quantized_rows_at_indices works correctly (the test prints "Both sampled AND dead indices have zero momentum: YES" before failing). Not a HIP/wave64 defect; would fail identically on CUDA.

All 3 failures are test/impl design mismatches in the upstream test source, not port regressions. The wave64-critical subset (tensor reductions, warp/block reductions, tensor-vs-torch parity, gsplat + fastgs rasterizers with cg::reduce shim + ballot, SSIM, MCMC, sort, matrix, random/curand) ALL pass.

### Verdict: PASS (lead linux-gfx90a)

## Validation 2026-05-31 (gfx1100, ROCm 7.2.1)

Arch: gfx1100 (AMD Radeon Pro W7800 48GB, RDNA3, wave32). HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0.
Fork tip validated: e24593f4ea6b1aff0f45b1dd98cab2209b0fd17e (moat-port). No fork push.

### Build

Deps fetched (absent on this host): glm 1.0.1 to /var/lib/jenkins/moat/_deps/glm-1.0.1;
args.hxx (Taywee) to /var/lib/jenkins/moat/_deps/lfs_args; nlohmann-json3-dev and
other apt deps installed (were missing from this host, same package list as gfx90a).

```

```

Result: 177/177 targets built, lfs_compute_tests linked. ZERO source edits (follower,
no code change needed; -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx1100 only).

### gfx1100 code-object evidence

roc-obj-ls on lfs_compute_tests: ALL bundles are hipv4-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx1100.
No gfx90a object present. Confirmed with `roc-obj-ls build-hip-gfx1100/cmake/hip_tests/lfs_compute_tests`.

### GPU test results

```
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ./build-hip-gfx1100/cmake/hip_tests/lfs_compute_tests
```

Run 1: 914 tests from 48 suites ran (~9.0 s). 912 passed, 2 failed.
Run 2: 914 tests from 48 suites ran (~8.8 s). 912 passed, 2 failed.
BIT-IDENTICAL across both runs (determinism confirmed).

vs gfx90a bar (911/3 failed): gfx1100 is BETTER (912/2 failed). The Canny
FP-boundary test (ImageKernelsTest.FusedCannyUInt8MatchesNormalizedFloatInput) PASSES
on gfx1100 -- the wave32 FP rounding lands on the passing side of the NMS hysteresis
discontinuity. Wave64/wave32 difference in float arithmetic order; both are correct
(wave-agnostic stencil kernel, no shfl/ballot; as documented in gfx90a notes this
test is a cross-input FP-decision-boundary sensitivity, not a kernel bug).

### Failures (2 total, same documented non-bugs as gfx90a)

1. MCMCTest.RemoveGaussiansSoftDeletesRows -- DOCUMENTED (pre-existing). Raw uint8
   quant exp_avg read as float; zero-point=128 means "0.0" stored as 0x80808080 (NaN
   as float). EXPECT_EQ(raw, 0.0f) vs zero-point=128. Pure integer quantization design
   mismatch in test vs impl; identical on any GPU. NOT a wave32 issue.
2. MCMCRelocateOptimizerStateTest.ResetBothSourceAndDestinationRows -- DOCUMENTED
   (pre-existing). Same class: EXPECT_GT(total_momentum, 0.0f) fails because raw uint8
   quant bytes interpreted as float give NaN. NOT a HIP/wave32 defect.

Wave32-critical subset run (--gtest_filter="*GSplat*:*Rasterize*:*Projection*:*Intersect*:*WarpReduce*:*BlockReduce*:*TensorReduction*:*SSIM*:*MCMC*:*Sort*"): 128/130 pass (2 MCMC quant non-bugs only). All splatting/reduction kernels PASS on wave32.

### Wave32 verdict on splatting and cooperative-groups reductions

The gsplat vendored backend (projection, intersect/tile, rasterize fwd/bwd, SH) and
the warp/block reduction kernels (kWarpSize=32 on gfx1100 as expected, butterfly
cg::reduce shim on cg::thread_block_tile<32> = exactly one wavefront on wave32) all
pass the libtorch parity oracle on gfx1100. The cooperative-groups tiled_partition<32>
is wave-agnostic; on gfx1100 it maps to a single 32-lane wavefront. Correct.

### Verdict: PASS (follower linux-gfx1100)
validated_sha = e24593f4ea6b1aff0f45b1dd98cab2209b0fd17e

## Validation 2026-06-05 (windows-gfx1101, Radeon PRO V710, RDNA3 gfx1101)

Arch: gfx1101 (Radeon PRO V710, RDNA3, wave32). HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0.
Fork branch tip: eebecafc51d7d77c77f0b6e61a9a3c3ad5557fdc (moat-port, adds Windows build fixes on top of e24593f).
Host: Windows 11 Pro, TheRock PyTorch venv (torch 2.9.1+rocm7.14.0a20260604, ROCm 7.14).

### Windows build changes (new commit eebecaf on top of e24593f)

The following Windows-specific changes were required to compile the compute tranche
on this host and are committed to the fork as the second commit:

- cmake/HipCompute.cmake: add NOMINMAX/_USE_MATH_DEFINES on WIN32; link amdhip64
  explicitly via CUDA::cudart (plain .cpp files including <cuda_runtime.h> need it
  on Windows); find and link clang_rt.builtins-x86_64 for float16 helpers that
  --nostdlib omits; gate OpenImageIO/OpenMesh find_library inside if(NOT WIN32).
- src/core/CMakeLists.txt: use image_io_win_stub.cpp and mesh_data_win_stub.cpp on
  WIN32 instead of OIIO/OpenMesh-dependent originals; drop those link entries.
- src/core/cuda/CMakeLists.txt: add exportable_storage_win_stub.cpp on WIN32 under
  USE_HIP (lld-link requires all symbols resolved at link time).
- src/core/logger.cpp: broaden #ifdef WIN32 to #if defined(WIN32)||defined(_WIN32)
  (clang on Windows defines _WIN32, not WIN32).
- src/core/tensor/internal/tensor_functors.hpp: explicit double casts for std::pow
  and std::fmod to resolve MSVC C2666 overload ambiguity on float args.
- src/hip_compat/c10/cuda/CUDACachingAllocator.h: shim redirecting
  <c10/cuda/CUDACachingAllocator.h> to the HIP counterpart + cuda namespace alias.

### Build

```
cmake -S projects/LichtFeld-Studio/src -B projects/LichtFeld-Studio/build-win-gfx1101 -G Ninja ^
  -DUSE_HIP=ON -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx1101 ^
  -DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER=<venv>/Lib/site-packages/_rocm_sdk_devel/lib/llvm/bin/clang++.exe ^

  -DROCM_PATH=<venv>/Lib/site-packages/_rocm_sdk_devel
cmake --build projects/LichtFeld-Studio/build-win-gfx1101 --target lfs_compute_tests
```

Result: 177/177 targets, lfs_compute_tests.exe produced. gfx1101 device code confirmed
embedded. HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 throughout.

### GPU test run

```
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 lfs_compute_tests.exe
```

Run 1: 914 tests from 48 suites ran (4516 ms). 320 passed, 564 failed, 30 skipped.
Run 2: 914 tests from 48 suites ran (4449 ms). 320 passed, 564 failed, 30 skipped.
Consistent across both runs.

Native HIP confirmed: hipGetDeviceCount() = 1 (gfx1101 present), err=0.
hipcc-compiled kernel tests that do NOT call torch::cuda::is_available() PASS.

### Root cause of failures (platform-level blocker)

torch::cuda::is_available() returns false in the standalone C++ exe. Traced to:
1. torch_hip.dll is built with lld-link (TheRock Windows PyTorch build).
   lld-link does NOT emit a .CRT$XCU section (no MSVC global constructor table).
2. _DllMainCRTStartup CRT init ptr (at RVA 0x399e8f0 in torch_hip.dll) = NULL.
   _initterm is never called -> REGISTER_CUDA_HOOKS static initializers never run.
3. TLS callbacks in torch_hip.dll (at RVA 0x0288aa90 and 0x0288ab40) trigger only
   on DLL_THREAD_ATTACH and DLL_THREAD/PROCESS_DETACH respectively; neither fires
   on DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH. DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH handler calls DisableThreadLibraryCalls.
4. CUDAHooksRegistry in torch_cpu.dll stays empty.
5. getCUDAHooks() constructs a stub implementing all methods as no-ops (hasCUDA()=false).
6. torch::cuda::is_available() -> getCUDAHooks().hasCUDA() -> false.

The ctypes path (Python import torch) bypasses CUDAHooksRegistry and works correctly
(torch._C._cuda_getDeviceCount() > 0 -> True). This is a TheRock Windows build
limitation, not a port defect.

### Failures (564 + 30 skipped, all same root cause)

564 tests fail: each begins with ASSERT_TRUE(torch::cuda::is_available()), which
immediately fails. Categories affected: TensorBasicTest (31), TensorOpsTest (55),
TensorReductionTest (35), TensorMathTest (35), TensorMatrixTest (32),
TensorBroadcastTest (29), TensorMaskingTest (74), TensorRandomTest (43),
TensorRandomAdvancedTest (23), TensorVsTorchTest (28), TensorFillVsTorchTest (12),
TensorClampTest (30), NaNInfGPUCheckTest (65), BoolReductionKernel (11),
BoolReduction (16), BoolAnyAllTest (31), CurandBufferOverflowTest (10),
FusedL1SSIMTest (14), MaskedFusedL1SSIMTest (9), MaskLossTest (19),
ActivationGradientsTest (5), GradientAccumulationTest (4), MCMCTest (3),
MCMCTensorOps (8), AppendGather (3), InplaceCat (2), MemoryLeak (3),
MCMCDeadMaskTest (21), MCMCNaNFixTest (4), MCMCLogitVerificationTest (7),
RelocateGsEdgeCasesTest (47), DensificationTensorOpsTest (59),
GsplatRasterizerTest (2), LfsSchedulerTest (17), PPISPCudaVsTorchTest (13),
PPISPRegularizationTest (15), ADMMSparsityOptimizerTest (3).
30 skipped: AnalyticalGradientTest (25) and CUDAKernelGradientTest (5) -- skip
themselves when is_available() is false.
1 disabled.

### Passing tests (320/914 -- real gfx1101 GPU, confirmed)

Suites that do NOT assert is_available() first:
TensorReductionAlignmentTest (7), TensorBoolTest (11), MinimalSortDebugTest (7),
CPUDtypeConversionTest (22), CPULargeTensorTest (15), TensorMathTest (sub-set),
TensorBroadcastTest (sub-set), TensorMaskingTest (sub-set), TensorFillVsTorchTest
(CPU sub-set), TensorClampTest (sub-set), MCMCRelocateOptimizerStateTest (3),
ImageKernelsTest (4). These exercise the custom HIP reduction kernels, tensor math,
and masking ops directly without the torch::cuda gate. GPU execution confirmed via
non-trivial kernel runtimes (TensorReductionAlignmentTest total 223 ms).

### Verdict: VALIDATION-FAILED (windows-gfx1101)
Blocked. Cannot fix torch::cuda::is_available()=false in standalone C++ exe without
modifying the TheRock PyTorch Windows build (lld-link .CRT$XCU omission). The HIP
port itself compiles and native HIP kernel tests pass on real gfx1101 GPU.
A TheRock fix would allow re-running tests from port-ready -> completed.

### Note for linux-gfx90a and linux-gfx1100 revalidators

The new commit (eebecaf) adds Windows-only changes. All new source files have
`#if defined(_WIN32)` top-level guards; all cmake changes for OIIO/OpenMesh are
inside `if(NOT WIN32)`. The Linux builds (gfx90a, gfx1100) compile NONE of the
new .cpp stubs and follow the SAME cmake paths as before. Binary-equivalence check
via `utils/codeobj_diff.py` between builds at e24593f and eebecaf is expected to
yield `verdict=identical` for Linux arches -- use carry-forward if confirmed.

## Revalidation 2026-06-05 (linux-gfx90a, gfx90a / MI250X, ROCm 7.2.1)

Arch: gfx90a (MI250X, wave64). GCD: HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0.
Fork validated at: 13e585d4775b69961221e21f8cddcb567d66b752 (moat-port).

### HEAD movement: eebecaf -> 13e585d

The original Windows commit (eebecaf) introduced a Linux build regression: the
new src/hip_compat/c10/cuda/CUDACachingAllocator.h shim unconditionally aliased
`namespace CUDACachingAllocator = c10::hip::HIPCachingAllocator`, but on Linux
ROCm PyTorch, c10::cuda::CUDACachingAllocator already exists (the Linux torch is
properly hipified), causing a redefinition error at build time. The shim is needed
only on Windows (where TheRock PyTorch is not fully hipified).

Fix: wrap the namespace alias in `#if defined(_WIN32)`, with `#include_next` on
Linux to pull the real hipified header unchanged. Committed as an amend to the
Windows commit and force-pushed to moat-port (13e585d).

### Build

From-scratch build at 13e585d (same CMake command as gfx90a validation 2026-05-31):

Result: 177/177 targets built, lfs_compute_tests linked. ZERO errors.

### GPU test results

```
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ./build-new/cmake/hip_tests/lfs_compute_tests
```

Run 1: 914 tests from 48 suites ran (13.4 s). 911 passed, 3 failed.
Run 2: 914 tests from 48 suites ran (12.9 s). 911 passed, 3 failed.
BIT-IDENTICAL across both runs (determinism confirmed).

### Failures (3 total, same documented non-bugs as previous gfx90a validation)

1. ImageKernelsTest.FusedCannyUInt8MatchesNormalizedFloatInput -- DOCUMENTED
   (gfx90a validation 2026-05-31 notes). 1-ULP cross-input FP boundary in Canny
   NMS hysteresis; wave-agnostic stencil kernel. NOT a port defect.
2. MCMCTest.RemoveGaussiansSoftDeletesRows -- DOCUMENTED. Reads raw uint8 quant
   exp_avg as float; zero-point=128 means "0.0" is 0x80808080 (NaN as float).
   Pure integer quantization design mismatch. Identical on any GPU.
3. MCMCRelocateOptimizerStateTest.ResetBothSourceAndDestinationRows -- DOCUMENTED.
   Same class as #2: raw uint8 quant bytes read as float give NaN. NOT a HIP defect.

All 3 failures are test/impl design mismatches in the upstream test source, not
port regressions. The wave64-critical subset (tensor reductions, warp/block
reductions, gsplat + fastgs rasterizers, cg::reduce shim, SSIM, MCMC, sort) ALL
pass. Results IDENTICAL to e24593f validation (911/3 split).

### Verdict: PASS (linux-gfx90a revalidation)
validated_sha = 13e585d4775b69961221e21f8cddcb567d66b752

## Revalidation 2026-06-05 (linux-gfx1100, AMD Radeon Pro W7800, RDNA3 gfx1100)

Arch: gfx1100 (AMD Radeon Pro W7800 48GB, RDNA3, wave32). HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0.

### HEAD movement: e24593f -> 13e585d

The Windows commit (13e585d) added Windows-specific build changes on top of the
validated Linux port (e24593f). Changes analyzed:
- New files: all have `#if defined(_WIN32)` top-level guards; not compiled on Linux.
- CMake changes: OpenImageIO/OpenMesh handling gated by `if(NOT WIN32)`; additional
  WIN32-only flags (NOMINMAX, _USE_MATH_DEFINES) and lib links (amdhip64 explicit,
  clang_rt.builtins for float16).
- src/hip_compat/c10/cuda/CUDACachingAllocator.h: new shim with `#if defined(_WIN32)`
  for the namespace alias; `#include_next` on Linux (pulls real hipified header).
- src/core/logger.cpp: broadens existing `#ifdef WIN32` to also check `_WIN32`
  (clang on Windows defines `_WIN32`). Linux still takes the `#else` branch; no change.
- src/core/tensor/internal/tensor_functors.hpp: adds explicit double casts to
  std::pow and std::fmod in the host code path (not `__CUDA_ARCH__`). This resolves
  MSVC overload ambiguity on Windows. On Linux it is mathematically identical
  (float->double->pow->T vs float->pow->T), just a different overload resolution.

Binary comparison (e24593f vs 13e585d) attempted via codeobj_diff.py: verdict=differ
due to the tensor_functors.hpp changes linking `fmod@GLIBC_2.38` instead of
`fmodf@GLIBC_2.38` and `pow@GLIBC_2.27` vs `powf@GLIBC_2.27`. The explicit double
casts change which glibc symbols are linked, so the binaries are NOT bitwise-identical,
though the math is equivalent. Full GPU revalidation required (not carry-forward eligible).

### Build

From-scratch build at 13e585d (same CMake command as gfx1100 validation 2026-05-31):

```
export HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0

```

Result: 177/177 targets built, lfs_compute_tests linked. ZERO errors.

### GPU test results

```
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ./lfs-new-gfx1100/cmake/hip_tests/lfs_compute_tests
```

Run 1: 914 tests from 48 suites ran (9115 ms). 912 passed, 2 failed.
Run 2: 914 tests from 48 suites ran (9191 ms). 912 passed, 2 failed.
BIT-IDENTICAL across both runs (determinism confirmed).

### Failures (2 total, same documented non-bugs as previous gfx1100 validation)

1. MCMCTest.RemoveGaussiansSoftDeletesRows -- DOCUMENTED (pre-existing). Reads raw
   uint8 quant exp_avg as float; zero-point=128 means "0.0" stored as 0x80808080
   (NaN as float). Pure integer quantization design mismatch. Identical on any GPU.
2. MCMCRelocateOptimizerStateTest.ResetBothSourceAndDestinationRows -- DOCUMENTED
   (pre-existing). Same class: raw uint8 quant bytes read as float give NaN. NOT
   a HIP/wave32 defect.

Results IDENTICAL to e24593f validation (912/2 split). The ImageKernelsTest.FusedCanny
test that passed on gfx1100 at e24593f still passes at 13e585d (wave32 FP rounding
lands on the passing side of the NMS hysteresis discontinuity). The wave32-critical
subset (tensor reductions, warp/block reductions, gsplat + fastgs rasterizers,
cg::reduce shim, SSIM, MCMC, sort) ALL pass.

### tensor_functors.hpp double-cast impact

The explicit double casts in tensor_functors.hpp (std::pow(double,double) and
std::fmod(double,double) instead of powf/fmodf) execute in the host code path
(not `__CUDA_ARCH__`) for CPU tensors. The test suite includes CPU tensor tests
(CPUDtypeConversionTest, CPULargeTensorTest) that exercise these paths; all pass.
The GPU device code path (under `__CUDA_ARCH__`) still uses powf/fmodf unchanged.
No regressions observed; the change is Windows-specific overload resolution, not
a semantic change on Linux.

### Verdict: PASS (linux-gfx1100 revalidation)
validated_sha = 13e585d4775b69961221e21f8cddcb567d66b752

## Test-gate expansion 2026-06-07 (linux-gfx90a, gfx90a / MI250X, ROCm 7.2.1)

Closes the lichtfeld-test-gate-coverage deferral: the gate (cmake/hip_tests/
CMakeLists.txt, LFS_HIP_TEST_FILES) linked only 44 compute test files and omitted
many built kernels, most notably tensor_nn_ops.cu (max_pool2d, adaptive_avg_pool2d,
conv1x1, linear, relu) which had no test at all.

### What was added (new commit 235c5905 on top of 13e585d)

Surveyed all 137 excluded test_*.cpp, classified by their includes (both <...> and
"..." -- the earlier validator survey missed angle-bracket includes). A file is
compute-only iff every project header it pulls is under core/tensor*, core/logger,
core/parameters, core/tensor_label, core/cuda/{memory_arena,sh_layout,kernels},
training/kernels, training/optimizer, or diagnostics/. 68 qualified. Added 56:
test_tensor_nn_ops plus 55 tensor-library / diagnostics tests. Result: gate grew
914 -> 2048 tests (119 suites).

Deliberately NOT added:
- 13 pure-timing *_benchmark / *_performance files (no correctness asserts; only add
  wall-clock to the gate).
- ~67 io/GUI/Vulkan/Python/USD/mesh-coupled files (those layers are not built under
  USE_HIP; they would fail to link). Includes the formats (ply/spz/sog/usd), scene/
  splat_data/camera/point_cloud (pull io), event_bridge/services/operator/selection,
  visualizer/rendering/gui/rmlui/sdl, mcp, python, sequencer.
- test_mcmc_histogram_optimization.cpp: references launch_count_occurrences_fast,
  a symbol that no longer exists anywhere in the source tree (the header now exports
  launch_histogram / launch_histogram_sort). It fails to COMPILE on any backend
  (verified: 0 matches in src/); a stale test, dropped.

lfs_diagnostics is PUBLIC-linked by lfs_core and lfs_training and its include dir is
PUBLIC, so diagnostics/vram_profiler.hpp resolves transitively -- no link/include
edit needed for test_vram_profiler_metrics.

### GPU run (serial, HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3, GCD 3; siblings on 0/1/2 untouched)

Binary rebuilt at 235c5905 (the ff to 13e585d triggered a full recompile via the
Windows-commit tensor_functors.hpp host double-cast; compiled clean, 166/166).

```
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3 ./build-hip/cmake/hip_tests/lfs_compute_tests
```
2048 tests from 119 suites, 2043 passed, 5 failed. BIT-IDENTICAL across three runs
(two at the pre-ff binary, one at 235c5905); ~14.3-14.8 s.

### The 5 failures (all non-bugs; none a GPU kernel defect)

3 pre-existing documented (see prior validations): MCMCTest.RemoveGaussiansSoftDeletesRows,
MCMCRelocateOptimizerStateTest.ResetBothSourceAndDestinationRows (both read a uint8
QUANTIZED moment buffer as float; zero-point=128 reads as NaN), ImageKernelsTest.
FusedCannyUInt8MatchesNormalizedFloatInput (1-ULP cross-input boundary in Canny NMS).

2 NEWLY surfaced by the added tests, both investigated and confirmed non-bugs:
- TensorLazyIrTest.OnModeDefersUntilBoundaryAndMaterializes (test_tensor_lazy_ir.cpp:106):
  asserts a direct `a.add(b)` (both CPU tensors) yields op_kind Deferred(5); the
  implementation classifies a binary op Binary(2). lazy_ir.cpp is pure host C++ with
  ZERO arch/HIP guards (grep count 0): the binary path -> Binary at line 226, a
  separate deferred path -> Deferred at line 288 (used by view-chains; the sibling
  test OnModeKeepsDeferredThroughViewChain which also expects Deferred PASSES). So
  this single assertion is a stale/incorrect expectation, arch-independent, fails
  identically on CUDA. Not a port defect, not a GPU kernel. Deterministic (fails in
  isolation too).
- TensorStressTest.DeepOperationChain (test_tensor_stress.cpp:103): a global
  free-memory leak heuristic (hipMemGetInfo). PASSES in isolation (OK, 443 ms); fails
  only in the full run with a -128 MB "leak" (i.e. MORE free at end -- impossible for
  a real leak), perturbed by the sibling processes on GPUs 0/1/2 sharing the device's
  global free-memory counter. A measurement artifact, not a kernel bug.

Both kept in the gate (the project already tolerates documented non-bug failures;
test_tensor_lazy_ir contributes 78 passing + test_tensor_stress 15 passing). The 2
new reds are documented here so a future validator does not re-triage them.

### State

head_sha -> 235c590583896c340aa32154f3fb12cc446418e6 (test-only delta on top of
13e585d; no device-code change to library kernels). advance_head classified the
CMakeLists change "mixed" (conservative -- .txt not in the inert allowlist) and
flipped both Linux platforms to revalidate. linux-gfx90a set back to completed
(validated_sha 235c5905) on the strength of the real-GPU run here. linux-gfx1100
stays revalidate -- its W7800 host confirms the test-only delta (codeobj_diff on the
library .so should be identical at 13e585d vs 235c5905; only the test exe gains
sources) and carries forward. Windows platforms unchanged (blocked).
