# Port plan: espresso (ESPResSo molecular dynamics)

## Project
- Name: espresso
- Upstream: https://github.com/espressomd/espresso
- Default branch: main (HEAD at planning: eafab258df3b, 5.0.1 release notes)
- Lead platform: linux-gfx90a

## DISPOSITION
PROCEED -- but as a SCOPED core-GPU port (electrostatics/magnetostatics), waLBerla GPU EXCLUDED.
Effort class: HEAVY-BUT-TRACTABLE on the C++ build axis, MODERATE on the actual GPU-port axis.
Concurrency flag: this build is HEAVY and finicky (mandatory MPI + Boost + FFTW + Python +
a configure-time FetchContent of several external projects). Do NOT run it as a fourth
concurrent heavy porter without watching disk/egress. The GPU code surface to port is small;
the cost is the build environment, not the kernels.

## Existing AMD support
Finding: ESPResSo ONCE HAD experimental HIP/ROCm support and it was REMOVED.
- Old docs/changelog: a `WITH_CUDA_COMPILER` option accepted `nvcc | clang | hip`; the HIP-Clang
  path was experimental, documented as "do not base hardware purchases on it," and has since
  been dropped. Current main (5.0.1) CMake has ZERO hip/rocm references; the CUDA-compiler
  options are NVIDIA (nvcc), Clang (clang-as-CUDA), and NVHPC only
  (CMakeLists.txt:310-338). No `WITH_CUDA_COMPILER=hip` remains.
- Web/orgs: no ROCm/AMD/GPUOpen-org fork, no separately-named AMD project (no ROCm-DS analogue),
  no live rocm/hip branch or open HIP PR upstream. The espressomd/docker issue #156 "Support for
  ROCm 3.1.0" tracked a CI image, not a code port, and predates the removal.
- Judgment: NO authoritative current AMD port exists. The removed HIP path is historical and
  long stale (pre-C++20, pre-CUDA-12, pre-waLBerla-bridge architecture); it is NOT a base to
  resurrect. Decision: FROM-SCRATCH HIP port our way (Strategy A), targeting only the core GPU.
  The old removed code may be consulted as a non-authoritative hint for which symbols mattered,
  never inherited.
- The current Clang-as-CUDA-compiler support is a helpful tailwind: clang-CUDA and clang-HIP
  share the same front end, so the host/device split and warnings are already clang-clean.

## Build classification
cmake (pure CMake C++ core + Python interface). Evidence:
- Top-level CMakeLists.txt, `enable_language(CUDA)` at CMakeLists.txt:274; CUDA arch via
  `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` (CMakeLists.txt:281-296); CUDA libs linked in
  src/core/CMakeLists.txt:62 (`CUDA::cuda_driver CUDA::cudart CUDA::cufft`).
- NOT a pytorch extension (no find_package(Torch), no CUDAExtension). Strategy A applies.
- ext_type = cmake.

### GPU surface is split into TWO subsystems -- this is the crux
1. ESPResSo CORE GPU (src/core, gated by ESPRESSO_BUILD_WITH_CUDA): exactly 5 compiled .cu TUs
   (src/core/CMakeLists.txt:55-61): cuda/common_cuda.cu, cuda/init_cuda.cu,
   cuda/CudaHostAllocator.cu, magnetostatics/dipolar_direct_sum_gpu_cuda.cu,
   electrostatics/p3m_gpu_cuda.cu, electrostatics/p3m_gpu_error_cuda.cu,
   system/GpuParticleData_cuda.cu. Small, self-contained, our code. cuFFT + Thrust + atomicAdd.
2. waLBerla bridge GPU (src/walberla_bridge, gated by ESPRESSO_BUILD_WITH_WALBERLA=ON default):
   ~70 code-generated .cu kernels (lattice-Boltzmann + electrokinetics). CRITICALLY, when
   WITH_WALBERLA=ON and CUDA=ON the build FETCHES the entire waLBerla framework from
   i10git.cs.fau.de (CMakeLists.txt:997-1028, GIT_TAG 3247aa73) and builds it with
   WALBERLA_BUILD_WITH_CUDA=on, pulling in `walberla::gpu` -- waLBerla's own CUDA backend.
   Porting that is porting a whole separate upstream (external, non-GitHub GitLab; egress-heavy).

### Minimal GPU build recipe (the scoped target)
Disable waLBerla to collapse the surface to the 5 core .cu files and avoid the waLBerla fetch:

    cmake -S . -B build \
      -G Ninja \
      -DESPRESSO_BUILD_WITH_CUDA=ON \
      -DESPRESSO_BUILD_WITH_WALBERLA=OFF \
      -DESPRESSO_BUILD_WITH_HDF5=OFF \
      -DESPRESSO_BUILD_WITH_SCAFACOS=OFF \
      -DESPRESSO_BUILD_WITH_STOKESIAN_DYNAMICS=OFF \
      -DESPRESSO_BUILD_WITH_GSL=OFF \
      -DESPRESSO_BUILD_WITH_NLOPT=OFF \
      -DESPRESSO_BUILD_WITH_CALIPER=OFF \
      -DESPRESSO_BUILD_WITH_FFTW=ON \
      -DESPRESSO_BUILD_WITH_PYTHON=ON \
      -DUSE_HIP=ON -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES="gfx90a;gfx1100" \
      -DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++
    cmake --build build -j16

Mandatory deps (apt/conda, install without asking): a C++20 compiler, CMake>=3.25, Ninja,
OpenMPI or MPICH (find_package(MPI 3.0 REQUIRED) at CMakeLists.txt:849 is UNCONDITIONAL -- MPI
cannot be turned off), Boost (mpi, serialization, system, filesystem), FFTW3 (CPU P3M),
Python3 + numpy + cython + scipy + h5py-less, and the ROCm stack (hipfft, rocfft, rocthrust/
hipcub). Even the GPU-only configuration links a CPU FFTW for the non-GPU P3M path.

Note: ESPResSo's GPU library selection is single-precision by default
(ESPRESSO_P3M_GPU_FLOAT defined, p3m_gpu_cuda.cu:32) so cuFFT->hipFFT needs the R2C/C2R
(single) entry points first; double (D2Z/Z2D) is compiled-out.

## Port strategy: A (compat header, colmap model)
Rationale: pure CMake, our own small .cu set, no Torch. Add `enable_language(HIP)` gated on a
`USE_HIP` option, mark the 5 core .cu sources `LANGUAGE HIP`, and add ONE compat header that
aliases the CUDA spellings the core uses to HIP and swaps cuFFT->hipFFT. Keep host C++ untouched.
On NVIDIA the header is a no-op and the existing nvcc/clang-CUDA paths are unchanged.

Port-vs-rewrite: MECHANICAL port is correct here. The core kernels are charge-assignment /
B-spline interpolation / direct dipole sums + an FFT -- no CUTLASS/wgmma/warp-specialized GEMM,
nothing that wants an AMD-native rewrite. cuFFT maps to hipFFT 1:1.

## CUDA surface inventory (CORE only; waLBerla excluded)
- Kernels: charge assignment, B-spline mesh interpolation, force back-interpolation, influence
  function, P3M error estimate; dipolar direct-sum forces/torques/energy. Plain __global__.
- cuFFT (electrostatics/p3m_gpu_cuda.cu): cufftHandle, cufftPlan3d, cufftExecR2C/C2R,
  cufftComplex, cufftDestroy, CUFFT_SUCCESS. Cleanly abstracted behind macros
  (FFT_TYPE_COMPLEX/FFT_FORW_FFT/... at p3m_gpu_cuda.cu:37-50). -> hipFFT: hipfftHandle,
  hipfftPlan3d, hipfftExecR2C/C2R, hipfftComplex, hipfftDestroy, HIPFFT_SUCCESS. Link hipfft.
- Thrust: device_vector / reduce / copy / raw_pointer_cast in p3m_gpu_error_cuda.cu and
  GpuParticleData_cuda.cu. -> rocThrust (thrust:: names unchanged under ROCm; just include path
  and link). No CUB, no DeviceReduce template-matrix bloat -> no --offload-compress needed.
- atomicAdd on float (p3m_gpu_cuda.cu:368/375/489-491) and into mesh/force arrays. Native on
  gfx90a (float atomics fine). No 64-bit/double atomics in the core force path.
- Streams: a single global cudaStream_t stream[1] (cuda/common_cuda.cu:34). -> hipStream_t.
- Pinned host memory: CudaHostAllocator.cu (cudaHostAlloc/cudaMallocHost-style). -> hipHostMalloc.
- Launch/error helpers: KERNELCALL macro `<<<>>>` + cudaGetLastError (cuda/utils.cuh:75-80),
  cuda_safe_mem (common_cuda.cu). `<<<>>>` is accepted by hipcc/clang-HIP; cudaGetLastError ->
  hipGetLastError via the compat header.
- cuRAND: NONE in the core. The thermostat/LB noise is a self-contained Philox header
  (walberla_bridge .../philox_rand.h + libs/Random123-1.09), counter-based, no cuRAND link.
  Since waLBerla is excluded from the port scope, no RNG library swap is needed at all.
- Textures / surfaces / cudaArray / layered arrays: NONE in the core. (The popsift texture/
  layered-array fault classes do not apply.)
- Warp intrinsics (__shfl/__ballot/__any/warpSize/__activemask) and hardcoded 32: NONE found in
  src/core. So the wave64-vs-wave32 fault class has NO direct trigger in the ported code.
- CUTLASS/CuTe/wgmma: none.

## Risk list
- waLBerla scope creep (PRIMARY RISK). If WITH_WALBERLA is left ON, the build fetches and
  HIP-compiles the entire waLBerla GPU backend -- out of scope, egress-heavy, a separate port.
  MITIGATION: build with -DESPRESSO_BUILD_WITH_WALBERLA=OFF; scope the PR claim to core GPU
  (P3M / dipolar / GpuParticleData). LB/EK GPU is explicitly future work.
- Build weight / environment. Mandatory MPI + Boost + FFTW + a C++20 toolchain + Python/Cython;
  even with options trimmed this is a multi-hundred-TU C++ build. Finicky: CUDA std is pinned to
  C++20 and CUDA version >=12 for nvcc; for the HIP path we sidestep the nvcc version gate
  (CMakeLists.txt:276-338 keys off CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER_ID, which the HIP language path bypasses).
- hipFFT R2C/C2R scaling/normalization parity. cuFFT and rocFFT/hipFFT both leave transforms
  UNNORMALIZED, but verify the inverse-transform 1/N handling in p3m_gpu_cuda.cu matches; a
  silent factor-of-N would surface as wrong forces, caught by the CPU-vs-GPU gate below.
- Float atomic ordering / determinism. atomicAdd into the mesh is order-nondeterministic on both
  vendors; use tolerance compares (the tests already do), not bit-exact.
- ffp-contract drift (clang-HIP defaults to -ffp-contract=fast). The B-spline weight chains are
  multi-statement; pin -ffp-contract=on in CMAKE_HIP_FLAGS to match CUDA/CPU FMA formation and
  keep the CPU-vs-GPU tolerance gate green. (CV-CUDA fault class.)
- Rule-of-five on the cufftHandle/stream wrappers. cuFFT plans live in a struct destroyed in a
  dtor (p3m_gpu_cuda.cu:113-138); ensure default-init and no double-destroy (AMD faults where
  CUDA tolerates). Audit the P3M data struct lifetime.
- Single global stream[1] (common_cuda.cu:34): a translation-unit-static handle; confirm it is
  created before first use and not destroyed twice across re-init.
- Wave size: no direct trigger in ported code, but BUILD the fat binary
  -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES="gfx90a;gfx1100" and confirm both code objects emit, so the follower
  gfx1100/gfx1151 validations need no source change.

## File-by-file change list (proposed; porter confirms)
- NEW src/core/cuda/cuda_to_hip.h (or reuse a single compat header): under USE_HIP, include
  <hip/hip_runtime.h> + <hipfft/hipfft.h>, alias the cuda*/cufft* symbols the 5 core TUs use
  (cudaMalloc/Free/Memcpy/MemcpyAsync, cudaStream_t, cudaError_t, cudaSuccess, cudaGetLastError,
  cudaHostAlloc/cudaFreeHost, cufftHandle/Plan3d/ExecR2C/ExecC2R/Complex/Destroy/SUCCESS, the
  CUFFT_* plan flags). Include <cstring>/<cstdlib> BEFORE hip_runtime (gpuRIR lesson).
- CMakeLists.txt: add option(USE_HIP ...); when USE_HIP, enable_language(HIP), default
  CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES to gfx90a only-if-unset (never hardcode the literal), pin
  -ffp-contract=on in the HIP flags.
- src/core/CMakeLists.txt: when USE_HIP, set_source_files_properties(the 5 .cu PROPERTIES
  LANGUAGE HIP); link hip::hipfft (+ rocthrust) instead of CUDA::cufft/cudart; set
  HIP_ARCHITECTURES on the target from CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES.
- Touch the 5 .cu files only as needed (include the compat header; guard any genuinely divergent
  line with #if defined(USE_HIP)). Expect this to be small.
- Leave src/walberla_bridge untouched (built CPU-only or omitted via WITH_WALBERLA=OFF).

## Build commands (gfx90a)
See "Minimal GPU build recipe" above. Multi-arch fat-binary check:
    llvm-objdump --offloading build/.../libespresso_core.so | grep -E "gfx90a|gfx1100"
(expect both). Single-arch run on gfx90a for the actual GPU tests.

## Test plan (real GPU, egress-feasible -- testsuite generates its own systems, no downloads)
Build with -DESPRESSO_BUILD_TESTS=ON. GPU tests carry the ctest `gpu` label
(testsuite/python/CMakeLists.txt:113-116). Primary CPU-vs-GPU consistency gates (core scope):
- testsuite/python/dawaanr-and-dds-gpu.py -- DipolarDirectSum GPU vs CPU: builds a random dipole
  system, compares per-particle forces AND torques GPU-vs-CPU within tolerance. IDEAL gate.
  (@skipIfMissingGPU; needs CUDA, DIPOLES, LENNARD_JONES features.)
- testsuite/python/p3m_madelung.py -- P3M GPU (gpu=True, single_precision) vs the analytic
  Madelung constant of an ionic crystal (built-in reference, no data file). Lines 230-271.
- testsuite/python/coulomb_cloud_wall.py -- P3M forces vs a shipped reference (cloud-wall), CPU
  and GPU variants; classic correctness gate.
- testsuite/python/p3m_electrostatic_pressure.py, p3m_fft.py -- additional P3M GPU coverage.
- C++ unit test: src/core/unit_tests/cuda_test.cu (CudaHostAllocator) -- a ctest under the core
  unit-test target; exercises the pinned-memory path on GPU.
Run:
    ctest --test-dir build -L gpu --output-on-failure
    # core-scope subset:
    ctest --test-dir build -R "dds_gpu|p3m_madelung|coulomb_cloud_wall|cuda_test" --output-on-failure
Non-GPU regression set (must not regress): the full CPU testsuite minus the `gpu` label, esp.
the CPU P3M/coulomb tests (coulomb_cloud_wall CPU variant, p3m_madelung CPU path) and the C++
unit tests. Run `ctest --test-dir build -LE gpu` for the non-GPU baseline.
Note: LB/EK GPU tests (lb*.py, the many lattice-Boltzmann tests) require waLBerla GPU, which is
OUT OF SCOPE; they are skipped/not-built in the WITH_WALBERLA=OFF configuration. Do not count
them as regressions.

## Open questions
1. Does building with WITH_WALBERLA=OFF still produce a usable espressomd Python module for the
   P3M/dipolar GPU tests? (Expected yes -- waLBerla only provides LB/EK; electrostatics is core.)
   Porter to confirm the trimmed config imports and the dds/p3m tests are collected.
2. hipFFT vs rocFFT: link hipFFT (CUDA-compatible API, minimal diff) or call rocFFT directly?
   Plan assumes hipFFT for a 1:1 macro swap.
3. Is the C++20 + CUDA-language interaction happy under the HIP language path (we bypass the
   nvcc>=12 gate, but confirm the core compiles as -x hip at C++20).
4. Future scope (NOT this port): waLBerla GPU LB/EK. That is a much larger, separate effort
   (port or upstream-coordinate waLBerla's own GPU backend); flag for a follow-up project.
